《'''他配不上'''》（{{lang-en|''He Wasn't''}}）是加拿大唱作歌手[[艾薇兒·拉維尼|艾薇兒·拉維尼]]2004年发行的第二张专辑《[[酷到骨子里|酷到骨子里]]》的第四支也是最后一支单曲。{{TransH}} It was not released in the [[美国|United States]]; instead, "Fall to Pieces" was released. The song was released in [[德国|Germany]], [[澳大利亚|Australia]] and the [[英国|United Kingdom]]. Beforehand, it was a released as a third single in [[日本|Japan]] in June 2004. It was written and produced by Lavigne and [[香岱兒|Chantal Kreviazuk]]. [[Allmusic|Allmusic]] highlighted the song as one of the most significant [[后油渍摇滚|post-grunge]] songs of all time.{{r|www.webcitation.org}}

== Song meaning ==
"He Wasn't" is about an unsuccessful relationship between Lavigne and a man who appears to be treating her badly, such as not even opening the door to her. The song is a fast and up-beat take on the boyfriend "not being good enough" as opposed to Lavigne's slower paced songs from ''[[酷到骨子裡|Under My Skin]]'' on the same matter. On a documentary of the making of the "[[我的幸福到此为止|My Happy Ending]]" music video, "He Wasn't" plays in the background and Lavigne jokes, "'He wasn't what I wanted'...is that a theme on my record?".{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

== Critical reception ==
"He Wasn't" was criticized for the shallowness of the lyrics. Sal Cinquemani of ''[[偏锋杂志|Slant]]'' magazine described the song as a "crappy faux-[[朋克搖滾|punk]] tune", mostly because of the lyrical content.{{r|slant}} David Browne of ''[[娱乐周刊|Entertainment Weekly]]'' described the song as a "bratty kiss-off" and labelled it "boardroom-approved mall punk" noting that it sounded similar to songs on Lavigne's first album, ''Let Go''.{{r|entertainmentweekly}}

However, "He Wasn't" has also been praised for its loud, catchy nature; Stephen Thomas Erlewine of [[Allmusic|Allmusic]] describes the song as "the fastest, loudest, catchiest, and best song here, and the one closest to the spirit and sound of ''[[展翅高飞_(艾薇儿·拉维尼专辑)|Let Go]]''".{{r|Allmusic}} He also highlighted the song as a 'track pick' in a review of the album, ''Under My Skin''.{{r|Allmusic}} Rolling Stone was positive "The album's best song, a raucous three-minute sprint called "He Wasn't," has a pretty vacant opening line ("There's not much going on today/I'm really bored") and a simple yet ambiguous chorus: "He wouldn't even open up the door/He never made me feel like I was special." but "The words are full of contempt and self-pity, but she sings them like she doesn't really care."<ref>https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/under-my-skin-20040610</ref> Yahoo Music! wrote: ""He Wasn’t" maintains this theme (broken relationship) with a dashing, Clash-style chorus that chastises this young man for not opening doors. Jeez, young women these days - one minute they’re wearing stack-heeled DMs and fairy queen ra-ra skirts and the next they give you hell for not acting like your dad."<ref>https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fuk.launch.yahoo.com%2F040602%2F33%2F1wp8w.html&date=2010-12-19</ref>

The video features Lavigne singing and her band playing instruments in the background. There are scenes where she dances around wearing white gloves, a pink skirt, and holding a [[魔杖|magic wand]] (she is portraying a [[小仙子|fairy]]), and other scenes where she is wearing devil horns on her head (she is portraying the [[魔鬼|devil]]). It turns out that Lavigne and her band are at a video shoot, and later get into a [[食物大戰|food fight]], much to the dismay of the directors - who are played by Lavigne and the band, all dressed up in wigs and suits. Avril then rebels and smashes her guitar into the camera lens, and then into the paper wall, where pink paint splashes out. The video ends with the band dancing and Lavigne doing the [[劈叉|splits]].

Also, during the shooting of the music video when the pink slime came out, Lavigne tells that days later her hair was still pink and she needed to redye it because during the next days she was scheduled to have a photoshoot with 'Cosmopolitan' and her hair was looking really messy and all pink.{{r|youtube}}
