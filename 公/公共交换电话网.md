'''公共交换电话网'''（'''{{lang|en|Public Switched Telephone Network}}'''或簡稱'''PSTN'''）是一种用于全球语音通信的[[电路交换|电路交换]]网络，是目前世界上最大的网络，拥有用户数量大约是8亿。PSTN包括電話線（雙絞線），光纖電纜，微波傳輸鏈路，蜂窩網絡，通信衛星，與海底電話電纜，所有互連通過交換中心包括移動和固定電話，從而允許在世界上的任何電話與任何其他終端通信。最初是固定線路的類比電話系統的網絡，PSTN的核心目前幾乎已完全數字化。

公共交换电话网最早是1876年由[[贝尔|贝尔]]发明的电话开始建立的。PSTN已经经历了[[磁石交换|磁石交换]]、[[空分交换|空分交换]]、[[程控交换|程控交换]]、[[数字交换|数字交换]]等等阶段，目前几乎全部是数字化的网络，依功能屬性分為端局、長途電話中心局、主中心局、及國際電話交換中心等。

公共交换电话网主要由[[交换系统|交换系统]]和[[传输系统|传输系统]]两大部分组成，其中，[[交换系统|交换系统]]中的设备主要是[[电话交换机|电话交换机]]，电话交换机也随着电子技术的发展经历了磁石式、步进制、纵横制交换机，最后到程控交换机的发展历程。[[传输系统|传输系统]]主要由传输设备和线缆组成，传输设备也由早期的载波复用设备发展到[[SDH|SDH]]，线缆也由铜线发展到[[光纤|光纤]]。

为了适应业务的发展，PSTN目前正处于满足语音、数据、图像等传送需求的转型时期，正在向[[NGN|NGN]]（Next Generation Network）、移动与固定融合的方向发展。

PSTN中使用的技术标准由[[国际电信联盟|国际电信联盟]]（{{lang|en|ITU}}）规定，采用E.163/E.164（通俗称作电话号码）进行编址。

[[File:PSTN_office_classification_hierarchy.svg|thumbnail]]
依照PSTN的傳輸距離，一般可分成五個等級：
===Class 1 (regional center)===
The class 1 office was the Regional Center (RC). <!--Regional centers served three purposes in the North American toll network (a) their connections were the "last resort" for final setup of calls when routes between centers lower in the hierarchy were not available (b) they were initially staffed by engineers who had the authority to block portions of the network within the region in case of emergencies or network congestion - although these functions were transferred after 1962 to the Network Control/Operations Center and the distributed Network Management Centers (see below)（c）they provided collection points (until the development of more advanced computer hardware and software for toll operators) for circuits that would be passed along to one of the international overseas gateways (which operated as special centers outside the formal North American hierarchy). The regional centers updated each other on the status of every circuit in the network. These centers would then reroute traffic around the trouble spots and keep each informed at all times. There were twelve Regional Centers in North America, ten in the United States, nine of which were operated by AT&T（[[White_Plains,_NY|White Plains, NY]], [[Wayne,_PA|Wayne, PA]], [[Pittsburgh,_PA|Pittsburgh, PA]], [[Norway,_Illinois|Norway, IL]] [a rural crossroads west of Chicago at the intersection of US highway 52 and IL highway 71 - an underground office built with hardened construction to withstand nuclear attack], [[Conyers,_Georgia|Conyers, GA]] in [[Rockdale_County,_Georgia|Rockdale County]], [[St_Louis,_MO|St Louis, MO]], [[Dallas,_TX|Dallas, TX]], [[Denver,_CO|Denver, CO]], and [[Sacramento,_CA|Sacramento, CA]]）, one by GTE（[[San_Bernardino,_CA|San Bernardino, CA]]）. Two centres in Canada were operated on behalf of the Trans-Canada Telephone System, one by Bell Canada（[[Montréal,_PQ|Montréal, PQ]]）, and one by [[SaskTel|Saskatchewan Telephone]],（[[Regina,_SK|Regina, SK]]）。

For control and oversight of the entire network hierarchy, AT&T established a Network Control Center in [[New_York_City|New York City]] in 1962, renamed the Network Operations Center and relocated to [[Bedminster,_NJ|Bedminster, NJ]] in 1977. Engineering supervision was also centralized in eight regional Network Management Centers. The realignment and dispersion of functions were done, in part, to ensure maximum network integrity in the event of a national emergency, a major concern in that era. The basic structure of this unit, although significantly altered since the [[AT&T_divestiture|AT&T divestiture]] in the 1980s, still exists as the Global Operations Center, with domestic regional centers in Colorado and Georgia.-->

===Class 2 (sectional center)===
The class 2 office was the Sectional Center (SC).<!-- The sectional center typically connected major toll centers within one or two states or provinces, or a significant portion of a large state or province, to provide interstate or interprovincial connections for long-distance calls. At various times, there were between 50 and 75 active class two offices in the network.-->

===Class 3 (primary center)===
class 3是主中心局（Primary Center，簡稱PC）<!-- Calls being made beyond the limits of a small geographical area where circuits are not connected directly between class 4 toll offices would be passed from the toll center to the primary center. These locations use high usage trunks to complete connection between toll centers. The primary center never served dial tone to the user. The number of primary centers in the network fluctuated from time to time, ranging between 150 and 230.-->

===Class 4 (toll center)===
{{main|Class 4 telephone switch}}
class 4是長途電話中心局（Toll Center，簡稱TC）, <!--Toll Point (TP), or Intermediate Point (IP). A call going between two end offices not directly connected together, or whose direct trunks are busy, is routed through the toll center. The toll center is also used to connect to the long-distance network for calls where added costs are incurred, such as operator handled services. This toll center may also be called the tandem office because calls have to pass through this location to get to another part of the network. Toll centers might have been operated either as interstate facilities, under the operation of AT&T Long Lines (GTE in a few cases), or by local telephone companies, handling long distance traffic to points within a particular operating company territory. Class 4 offices continue to exist, although with considerable changes, as they handle local exchange company interconnections, locally charged or long distance rated, or provide facilities for connection to long distance company points of presence.-->

===Class 5 (local exchange)===
{{main|Class 5 telephone switches}}
class 5是區域交換（local exchange）或稱端局（End Office，簡稱EO）. <!--It delivers dial tone to the customer. The end office, also called a branch exchange, is the closest connection to the end customer. Over 19,000 end offices in the United States alone provide basic [[dial_tone|dial tone]] services.

In modern times only the terms Class 4 and Class 5 are much used, as any tandem office is referred to as a Class 4. This change was prompted in great part by changes in the power of switches and the relative cost of transmission, both of which tended to flatten the switch hierarchy. The breakup of the Bell System, and the need for each of the surviving regional operating companies to handle long distance interconnections, also promoted the inclusion of inter-regional and international processing through larger Class 4 offices.-->

===International Overseas Call Centers===
<!--The special requirements of placing calls to locations outside main Canadian/United States points meant that these calls were handled by special operators in locations where connections could be monitored to other countries. The technology to automate these connections through "regular" operator traffic positions  began to develop in the 1960s（see Bell Laboratories Record 42:7, July-August 1964）. As the decade of the 1970s progressed, North American customers who were served by electronic offices began to be able to directly dial to an increasing number of international points, a service known as [[IDDD|IDDD]]（International Direct Distance Dialing），（service between ESS offices in New York and London began on March 1, 1970）. However, since points could not be connected until equipment in both countries was converted to electronic switching, implementation to many locations took some time, and while the majority of calls began to be connected via automated systems by the 1990s - after the termination of the five-level hierarchy - the majority of countries were still connected via manual intervention until the beginning of the 21st century.

Please note that the currently attached diagram of switch hierarchy is incorrect, as it identifies Class 1 points with International switching. International connections were located in places generally close to cable, later satellite, termination locations, and were not directly related to Class 1 switches. Major international connection points were located in Oakland, California; Miami, Florida; and New York, New York, with a number of secondary international operator toll points. Only after the rapid expansion of ESS terminal offices did operator handling of international calls begin to be off-loaded into the domestic network structure, as international calling services began to be customer dialable, ca. the mid-1980s. This in part paralleled the demise of the five-level hierarchy, so identification of international switches and class one offices is incorrect.
