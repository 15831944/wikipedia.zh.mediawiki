《'''关于称义教义的联合声明'''》（{{lang-en|'''''Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification'''''}}，JDDJ），也称《'''因信称义联合声明'''》，是一份由[[天主教会|天主教会]]和{{tsl|en|Lutheran World Federation|世界信義宗聯會}}于1999年正式签署的一份声明。该联合声明宣称双方教会对“通过对[[基督|基督]]的[[信念_(基督教)|信念]]，凭借[[基督教的神|神]]的[[恩典|恩典]]称义”这一观点的一致<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/chrstuni/documents/rc_pc_chrstuni_doc_31101999_cath-luth-joint-declaration_en.html |title = JOINT DECLARATION ON THE DOCTRINE OF JUSTIFICATION |publisher = [[圣座|圣座]]官方网站 |accessdate = 2012-12-24}}</ref>。

签署双方認為，聲明基本上解决了对于[[称义|称义]]本质认识的争议，而这一争议正是[[宗教改革|宗教改革]]的基础。至於另外兩大國際性信義宗組織，包括[[國際路德會|國際路德會]]與[[世界路德宗認信聯會|世界路德宗認信聯會]]，則對《因信稱義聯合聲明》普遍持否定態度，<ref>[http://ncronline.org/blogs/all-things-catholic/german-pope-heads-land-luther A German pope heads for the Land of Luther], National Catholic Reporter, 2 Sept 2011 {{en}}, saying "To be sure, the Joint Declaration has not exactly brought about an ecumenical New Jerusalem. Some Lutherans have rejected the agreement, including the International Lutheran Council and the Confessional Evangelical Lutheran Conference. On the Catholic side, the Vatican’s approval remains officially binding, but enthusiasm varies."</ref>認為聲明內容含糊不清，<ref name=WELS-JDDJ>{{cite web|url=https://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?1518&cuTopic_topicID=19&cuItem_itemID=6741 |title=WELS Topical Q&A - Justification |quote=To put it mildly, confusion and not clarity reigns. The biblical Lutheran teaching of “forensic” justification maintains that the only effective cause of our forgiveness is a verdict of God that takes place outside of ourselves. We are declared “not guilty” entirely on the basis of what Christ has done for us. Catholic teaching on justification makes a change within man part of the cause of our forgiveness. The Joint Declaration does not represent a change in the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church. It does nothing to repudiate Rome’s historic position on the doctrine. The Joint Declaration is nothing more than an ambiguous statement, carefully worded to make it possible for the Pope’s representatives to sign it without changing, retracting, or correcting anything that has been taught by the Roman Catholic Church since the time of the Council of Trent in the sixteenth century. The Joint Declaration is a compromise. It masquerades as a significant change which brings Roman Catholicism in line with confessional Lutheranism on the teaching of justification. In fact, it is a deception that presents the appearance of agreement without any real substance that would make agreement possible. It is a thinly veiled attempt on the part of ecumenicism to embrace Catholicism. In the final analysis it appears that Rome has moved closer to reattaching what was lost in the sixteenth century without any substantive change in its doctrinal position. |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090927135957/https://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?1518&cuTopic_topicID=19&cuItem_itemID=6741 |archivedate=2009-09-27 }}</ref>簽署雙方實際上只是各說各話，嚴格來說不算是一份「協定」。<ref>[http://www.lcms.org/Document.fdoc?src=lcm&id=339 The Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justiﬁcation in Confessional Lutheran Perspective]</ref><ref name=mccain>{{cite news| url=http://firstthings.com/blogs/evangel/2010/03/a-betrayal-of-the-gospel-the-joint-declaration-on-the-doctrine-of-justification/| title=A Betrayal of the Gospel: The Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification| last=McCain| first=Rev.

That's not a real agreement. That's an agreement to disagree--on the teaching by which, as the Reformers said, 'the church stands or falls.' In truth, we are still back to where we started on Oct. 31, 1517. The Pope has made it clear. It's a question of indulgences--again"</ref>
