Baptiste cemented his place in the starting line up in the latter stages of the [[Blackpool_F.C._season_2008-09|2008–09 season]], playing either centre back or right back. On 20 January 2010, after 27 appearances and two goals in the [[Blackpool_F.C._season_2009–10|2009–10]] season, Baptiste signed a new two-and-a-half-year contract until June 2013. He said of the new contract: ''"I am very pleased. I had a good chat with the [[Ian_Holloway|gaffer]] and [[Steve_Thompson_(footballer_born_1964)|Thommo]] and the direction of the club is upwards and I want to be a part of it."'' Blackpool manager Ian Holloway expressed his belief that Baptiste can play in the [[Premier_League|Premier League]]: ''"Baps has played at left-back, right-back and centre-back and he has been different class. I believe he can play in the Premiership and I have told him that. I am working on the areas that he needs working on, but as a defender I don't think I have had a better one and I am delighted he has signed."''<ref name="bfc1938229">{{cite news|url=http://www.blackpoolfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10432~1938229,00.html|title=Baps Pens New Deal|date=20 January 2010|publisher=[[Blackpool_F.C.|Blackpool F.C.]]|accessdate=20 January 2010|location=[[Blackpool|Blackpool]]| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100125163256/http://www.blackpoolfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10432~1938229,00.html| archivedate= 25 January 2010 | deadurl= no}}</ref>
