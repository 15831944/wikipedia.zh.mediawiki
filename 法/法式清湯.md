'''法式清湯'''（'''consommé'''）是一種[[清湯|清湯]]，用調味過的[[高湯|高湯]]或者[[肉汁清湯|肉汁清湯]]澄清（使用[[蛋白|蛋白]]去除雜質）後製作<ref>[http://localkitchenblog.com/2009/04/22/how-to-clarify-cloudy-chicken-stock/ How to Clarify Cloudy Chicken Stock]</ref>。由於製作程序繁複且需要高深技巧，亦被稱為'''黃金湯'''<ref>[https://cn.nytimes.com/food-wine/20130504/cc04recipe/zh-hant/ 這就是傳說中的「高湯」] - [[紐約時報中文網|紐約時報中文網]]（2013年5月4日）</ref>。

==烹調與提供法式清湯==
法式清湯是混合絞肉、[[mirepoix|mirepoix]]（混合胡蘿蔔、芹菜與洋蔥的綜合蔬菜）、蕃茄與蛋白等等，混合[[肉汁清湯|肉汁清湯]](Bouillon)或者[[高湯|高湯]](stock)裡面。 <!--The key to making a high quality consommé is 去渣；去渣的作法, combined with frequent stirring, brings impurities to the surface of the liquid, which are further drawn out due to the presence of acid from the tomatoes. Eventually, the solids begin to congeal at the surface of the liquid, forming a 'raft', which is caused by the proteins (including albumins, mucoproteins, and globulins) in the egg whites. Once the 'raft' begins to form, the heat is reduced, and the consommé is simmered at a lower heat until it reaches the desired flavor, which usually takes anywhere from 45 minutes to over an hour. The resulting concoction is a clear liquid that has either a rich amber colour (for beef or veal consommé) or a very pale yellow colour (for poultry consommé). It is then carefully drawn from the pot and passed again through a filter to ensure its purity, and is then put through a lengthy process where all of the visible fat is skimmed from the surface. To ensure total purification, the consommé can be refrigerated, which draws out remaining fat, which can easily be skimmed off with cheesecloth. Alternatively, the consommé can be placed in a wide, shallow container such as a sauté pan or large bowl and wide strips of [[Parchment_paper_(baking)|parchment paper]] can be dragged along the surface; the tiny amounts of remaining fat adhere to the parchment, leaving the consommé perfectly de-greased. Cartilage and tendons should be left on the meat because of the [[gelatin|gelatin]] they contain, which enhances the [[mouthfeel|mouthfeel]] of the soup. If beef or veal is used, [[Shinbone|shin]] meat is ideal<ref>[http://www.globalgourmet.com/food/egg/egg0397/eggsalad.html All About Consomme]</ref> because it is very low in fat and very high in gristle, and although it is undesirable for most other purposes, it is near essential for the flavour of the consommé. The meat is best if it is ground very fine, as if for a [[mousseline|mousseline]].

Consommés are usually served piping hot because they tend to cool down more quickly than other soups and form a [[gel|gel]]. They are most often served with garnishes, which vary in complexity from a simple splash of [[sherry|sherry]] or egg yolk, to cut vegetables, to shaped savory custards called 'royales'.

A large amount of meat only yields a small amount of consommé; in some recipes, as much as 500 g (a little over a pound) of meat can go into a single 250 mL (8.2 fl oz) serving.

==Varieties==
Double consommé is a consommé made to double strength. There are different methods of production. Some{{who|date=July 2012}} say to double the quantity of meat, others say make it normal strength, then [[Reduction_(cooking)|reduce]] it (cook it down) to half of its volume.<ref>http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-consomme.htm</ref> Still others<ref>http://www.nomenu.com/joomla1/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1194:petite-marmite&catid=214:vegetable-and-bean-soups&Itemid=214</ref> say make it with a stock or broth that uses a consommé as its liquid component instead of water. It is often found in other cold-cuisine items, especially those that use [[aspic|aspic]], or natural gelatin.

Another common variation is cold jellied consommé, which, as the name implies, is served cold, and has more gelatin in it.

==Gelatin-filtered "consommé"==
In a 2007 ''New York Times'' article,<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9807E7D71539F936A3575AC0A9619C8B63 THE CURIOUS COOK; The Essence of Nearly Anything, Drop by Limpid Drop]</ref> [[Harold_McGee|Harold McGee]] popularized an alternative method for clarifying broths, originating among chefs of the [[molecular_gastronomy|molecular gastronomy]] movement: [[gelatin|gelatin]] filtration. Gelatin-filtration is a novel method of clarification, relying on some of the properties of a super-[[wiktionary:saturated|saturated]] solution of gelatin, created by [[freezing|freezing]], to remove macroscopic particles that cause cloudiness from a water-based [[stock_(food)|stock]]. This method is distinct from traditional consommé both in technique and in final product, as gelatin filtration results in a gelatin-free broth, while traditional consommé gives a final product rich in gelatin, with a correspondingly rich [[mouthfeel|mouthfeel]].

Freezing a water-based solution converts all bulk water into ice crystals, but water associated with [[solutes|solutes]]—in the case of a soup stock, gelatin, fat, and flavor compounds—remains unfrozen to much lower temperatures; in practice, the freezing temperature of this associated water is well below the reach of conventional freezers. Thus, gelatin filtration works by freezing a gelatin-containing, water-based solution and then allowing it to thaw in a mesh strainer at just above the freezing temperature of water. The gelatin and other solutes concentrate in the unfrozen, associated water, and the gelatin forms a stable network through cross-linking, just as it would in a standard gel. This stable network acts as a filter, trapping large particles of fat or protein, while allowing water and smaller, flavor-active compounds to pass. As the bulk water melts, it passes first through the gelatin network and then through the mesh strainer, into a receiving vessel. Because the temperature is kept just above the freezing point, the bulk water melts slowly and, as it is strained into a separate vessel, it is never in contact with the gelatin for long enough to begin dissolving the gelatin network. After all of the bulk water melts, the gelatin network remains in the strainer with the trapped macroscopic particles, and the clarified stock (the bulk water and flavor compounds) is collected in the receiving vessel.

Because gelatin-filtered consommés do not require a [[#Cooking_and_serving_consommés|creation of an egg-white raft]] as in traditional consommés, they are less wasteful. The technique is also applicable to a wider range of "stocks": since no heating is required, heat-sensitive materials, such as fruit juices, can be clarified by first adding a small amount of gelatin, then applying gelatin filtration. A number of non-traditional consommés, not based on stock, have been created using this method, including a "Doritos consommé", a "brown butter consommé", and a "spiced pumpkin consommé".<ref>[http://news.curiouscook.com/2007/10/curious-cook-in-new-york-times.html Curious Cook in the New York Times: Clarifying liquids with gelatin]</ref>

Loss of gelatin essential to gelatin filtration results in a consommé with significantly less-rich mouthfeel than a traditional consommé, and also affects the properties of the consommé upon chilling. A traditional consommé [[#Varieties|gels]] when chilled, while a gelatin-filtered consommé does not.

==歷史==
從[[中世紀|中世紀]]以來，就開始將澄清過後的高湯稱作法式清湯，有從使用簡單的湯，到使用各種少見動物肉類的不同版本。一種特殊的法式清湯僅使用[[腱|腱]]和[[軟骨|軟骨]]，不使用鹽，改用水果來增加甜味和香味，並作為點心。這種甜的法式清湯可以說是現代[[明膠|明膠]]點心的始祖。
