'''擁車證'''（{{lang-en|Certificate of Entitlement, COE}}），是政府透過車輛牌照配額許可證的發行，授予成功中標的持有人進行登記，擁有與使用新加坡道路，為期10年的合法權利。需求高時，COE的成本可能超過汽車本身的價值<ref>{{cite web|last=Grant |first=Jeremy |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/336b90cc-a39e-11e3-aa85-00144feab7de.html |title=Singapore overtakes Tokyo as world's most expensive city |publisher=FT.com |date=4 March 2014 |accessdate=7 July 2014}}</ref>。

== 起源 ==
起源於新加坡於1990年為了治理城市交通擁堵採取的一種措施。新加坡約有80萬輛汽車，其中約50萬輛為小汽車。

== 系統 ==
在購買新的車輛之前，在新加坡，潛在的車主都必需要向[[陸路交通管理局|陸路交通管理局]]（LTA）先申辦[[COE|擁車證]](Certificate of Entitlement)。

=== COE Category Refinement in 2013 ===

In September 2013, The COE system has been refined to include a new criterion for Category A cars. Under the change, the engine power of Cat A cars should not exceed 97 kilowatts (kW). This is equivalent to about 130 brake horsepower. This is in addition to the previous criterion of engine capacity of Cat A cars not exceeding 1600 cubic centimetres. However, cars with engine power output exceeding 97 kW will be classified under Category B in COE bidding exercises starting February 2014 despite having engine capacity below 1600 cubic centimetres. The review of the COE categories' criteria was because LTA wanted to differentiate and regulate the buying of mass market and premium cars under Cat A in a bid to control COE prices that hovered closer and closer to S$100,000.<ref>[http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/coe-system-to-include/806728.html COE System to Include Engine Power for Cat A Cars]</ref>

=== 牌照分類 ===
最初，牌照准證(COEs)分成八大類，但該系統現已被簡化為僅僅五個類別。A組、B組、與D組 是不可轉讓的。Taxis used to be classed under category A but issuance of COEs became unrestricted from August 2012 onwards.<ref>{{cite news|title=Taxis out of COE bidding process from August|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1216123/1/.html|accessdate=27 February 2013|newspaper=Channel News Asia|date=27 July 2012}}</ref>

From April 2010, the COE quota calculation was amended. Under the new methodology, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) recycles the COE quota from the actual vehicle deregistrations in the most recent six-month period back into the system. Instead of an annual quota, figures will be revised every six months. For example, there are 800,000 vehicles as of January. Based on the allowable growth rate of 1.5 percent, there will be an additional 6000 COEs for sale every six months. On top of the number of vehicles deregistered in the same period (for example, 20,000) this means the COE quota for July to December will be 26,000.

In early October 2011, Singapore Minister for Transport Lui Tuck Yew has said that Singapore's annual vehicle growth cap would be cut further from 2012. The annual vehicle population growth rate will be lowered from the current 1.5% to 1.0% in 2012, and then to 0.5% in 2013 and 2014, and then to 0.25% in 2015.

The lower vehicle growth rate will be more closely aligned to the pace of road growth going forward. However, in May 2012, Lui Tuck Yew did an about turn and said that more COE may be released and the plans to quotas cut car growth would be delayed.
