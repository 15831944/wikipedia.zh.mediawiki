 <!--|ShortSummary = <!--Dexter Morgan ([[Michael_C._Hall|Michael C. Hall]]) is introduced as a serial killer who kills other killers who have escaped from, or haven't been found by the justice system. By day he is a blood spatter analyst who works for the Homicide Department of the Miami Metro Police. Dexter has a quasi-relationship with Rita Bennett ([[Julie_Benz|Julie Benz]]), a similarly troubled divorcee raising two young children while her husband is in prison. One day, Dexter is called to a murder scene involving mutilated bodies, but with no blood visible. The murderer, soon to be nicknamed the "Ice Truck Killer", intrigues Dexter with this intricate methodology and a personal message in form of a mutilated doll. At the same time, Dexter's hard-nosed sister Debra ([[Jennifer_Carpenter|Jennifer Carpenter]]), a vice squad officer, tries to gain a transfer into the Homicide Department.-->
