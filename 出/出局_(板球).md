在[[板球|板球]][[体育运动|运动]]中，'''出局'''意味着[[板球击球手|击球手]]被迫离开赛场（即被取得[[三柱门|三柱门]]）。

==出局方式==
击球手可以因许多方式出局，其中最常见的是被投杀（bowled）、被接杀（caught）、用[[触身出局|触身出局]]（lbw）、被击杀（stumped）和被追杀（run out）。比较少见的是打门出局（hit wicket）、二击出局（hit the ball twice）、手球出局（handled the ball）、阻守出局（obstructing the field）和超时退场（timed out）。

[[投球手_(板球)|投球手]]只能在击球手被投杀、触身出局、被接杀、被击杀和被追杀而出局的情况下记作取得三柱门的成绩。如果投球被判作[[废球|废球]]（no ball），则击球手不能因任何上述原因而出局。但是击球手可以在任何投球的情况下因追杀、手球出局、二击出局、阻守出局或超时退场。
<!--A batsman can be dismissed in a number of ways, the most common being bowled, caught, [[leg_before_wicket|leg before wicket]] (LBW), stumped and run out.  Much rarer are hit wicket, hit the ball twice, handled the ball, obstructing the field and timed out. 

The [[bowler_(cricket)|bowler]] only "gets credit" for a wicket if the batsman is out bowled, LBW, caught, stumped, or hit wicket. If the ball is a [[no_ball|no ball]] then the batsman cannot be out in any of these ways. The batsman can, however, be out run out, handled the ball, hit the ball twice, obstructing the field, or timed out on any ball.
-->
===规则2.9(b)：退场===
<!--
If any batsman leaves the field of play without the Umpire's consent for any reason other than injury or incapacity, he may resume the innings only with the consent of the opposing captain. If he fails to resume his innings, he recorded as being ''Retired - out''.

Only two players in Test history have ever been given out in this manner, [[Marvan_Atapattu|Marvan Atapattu]] and [[Mahela_Jayawardene|Mahela Jayawardene]] - both in the same match playing for [[Sri_Lanka|Sri Lanka]] against [[Bangladesh|Bangladesh]] in [[September_2001|September 2001]].
-->
除受伤或不能比赛之外，任何击球手在未经裁判同意情况下离开赛场，他只能在对方队长同意之下在同一局继续比赛。如果他未能恢复此局，则将被记作“退场”出局（retired out）。

在对抗赛历史上只有两位球员，即Marvan Atapattu和Mahela Jayawardene，在2001年9月[[斯里兰卡|斯里兰卡]]对[[孟加拉|孟加拉]]的比赛中因此出局。

===规则30：[[投杀|投杀]]===
<!--If a bowler's delivery hits the [[stump_(cricket)|stumps]] and dislodges a [[bail_(cricket)|bail]], the ''striker'' (the batsman facing the bowler) is out. The ball can either have struck the stumps directly, or have been deflected off the bat or body of the batsman. However, the batsman is not out bowled if the ball is touched by a [[fielder|fielder]] before hitting the stumps.
-->
如果投球手投球击中[[三柱门|三柱门]]并使[[横木|横木]]掉落，则击球员（面对投球手的击球手）出局。所投之球可以直接击中门柱，或经击球手的球板或身体折射击中门柱。但如果球在击中门柱之前碰到[[防守_(板球)|守备员]]，则击球员不出局。
===规则31：超时退场===
<!--If a new player takes more than three minutes to enter the field of play after the previous batsman was ruled out, then the new player is out. In the case of extremely long delays, the umpires may forfeit the match to either team. This method of taking a wicket has never been employed in the history of Test cricket.
-->
前一位击球手出局，至新球员上场之间的间隔若超过三分钟，则该球员出局。如果出现极长的延误，裁判可以剥夺任意一方的比赛资格。此种取得三柱门的方式从未在对抗赛历史中出现过。

===规则32：[[接杀|接杀]]===
<!--If the striker strikes the ball with the bat and the ball is caught by the bowler or a fielder before it hits the ground, then the striker is out.

"Caught behind" indicates that a player was caught by the wicket-keeper.
-->
击球员使用球板击球之后，若球在场内落地之前被任何防守球员接到，则击球员出局。

“身后接杀”（caught behind）是指击球员被[[守门手|守门手]]接杀。

===规则33：手球出局===
<!--If the batsman touches the ball with his hand for any purpose other than, with the approval of the fielders, to return the ball to the bowler, he is out. 

Only seven batsman have been out ''handled the ball'' in the history of Test cricket ([[Russell_Endean|Russell Endean]], [[Andrew_Hilditch|Andrew Hilditch]], [[Mohsin_Khan|Mohsin Khan]], [[Desmond_Haynes|Desmond Haynes]], [[Graham_Gooch|Graham Gooch]], [[Steve_Waugh|Steve Waugh]] and, most recently, [[Michael_Vaughan|Michael Vaughan]]).
-->
如果击球员并非在守备员允许之下，将球还给投球手，而是以任何目的以手触球，则该击球员出局。

板球对抗赛历史上仅有七名球员因此出局（Russell Endean，Andrew Hilditch，Mohsin Khan，[[德斯蒙德·海恩斯|德斯蒙德·海恩斯]]，Graham Gooch，[[史蒂夫·沃|史蒂夫·沃]]和[[迈克尔·沃恩|迈克尔·沃恩]]）。

===规则34：二击出局===
<!--If the batsman hits the ball twice, he is out. But the second hit must be an actual hit: the batsman may stop the ball a second time with his bat; this action is often performed to stop the ball from hitting the stumps. 

No batsman has been out ''hit the ball twice'' in [[Test_cricket|Test cricket]].
-->
如果击球员击球两次，则出局；但第二次击球必须是真正的挥击（击球员可以使用球板二次触球使球停下，仅仅是用来阻止球击中门柱）。

没有任何击球手在板球对抗赛中因此出局。

===规则35：打门出局===
<!--If the batsman dislodges his own stumps with his body or bat, he is out.

This law does not apply if he was avoiding a ball thrown back to the wicket by a fielder, or broke the wicket in avoiding a run out.
-->
如果击球员的身体或球板将自己门柱上的横木碰落，则该击球员出局。

此规则不适用于击球员躲避守备员扔回三柱门的球，或避免被追杀时碰撞三柱门的情况。

===规则36：[[触身出局|触身出局]]===
<!--If the ball strikes any part of the batsman's anatomy (not necessarily the leg), and, in the [[Umpire_(cricket)|umpire]]'s judgement, the ball would have hit the batsman's stumps had his anatomy not intervened, then the batsman is out. There are some subtleties, however, to do with where the ball pitches (bounces), whether the batsman intentionally hit the ball with his body or attempted to play a legitimate stroke with the bat, and exactly where it hits the batsman in relation to the line of the stumps. In any case, if it seems that the ball would not have struck the stumps, the batsman is not out.
-->
如果球击中击球手身体的任意部分（并非必须是腿），并且在[[裁判_(板球)|裁判]]的判断下，如果击球手的身体没有阻挡住球，则球会击中他身后的门柱，那么该击球手出局。另外还有些细节问题需要考虑，如球的落地点，击球员是否有意以身体挡球或试图使用球板打出合法的一击，以及球击中击球手的位置与门柱线的关系。在任何情况下，如果球似乎并不会击中门柱，则击球员不应出局。

===规则37：阻守出局===
<!--If the batsman, by action or by words, obstructs a fielder, then he is out. However, a batsman is allowed to obstruct the view of a fielder by standing in front of him. He may also stand in between the fielder and the stumps. The rule intends to prevent batsman from interfering with  a fielder by, for instance, pushing him. 

Only one individual has ever been out ''obstructing the field'' in a Test match (when England's [[Len_Hutton|Len Hutton]] in [[1951|1951]], playing against South Africa at [[The_Oval|The Oval]] in London, prevented the South Africans from catching him whilst knocking the ball away from his stumps).
-->
如果击球手以动作或话语阻碍防守队员，他将出局。但击球手允许站在防守队员之前阻挡其视野。他也可以站在防守者与门柱之间。此规则主要是防止击球手利用，如推搡，干扰防守队员。

历史上仅有一名球员在对抗赛中因“阻碍防守”而出局（英格兰队的勒恩·郝顿，1951年在伦敦[[椭圆球场|椭圆球场]]对南非队，将球击离自己的门柱时阻碍南非人将其接杀）。

===规则38：[[追杀|追杀]]===
<!--If a fielder uses the ball to remove the bails from either set of stumps whilst the batsmen are running between the [[wicket|wicket]]s (or otherwise away from the crease during the course of play), then the batsman (striker or non-striker) is out. The batsman nearest the set of stumps from which the bails were removed, but not actually in safe territory, is given out. If the batsman has any part of his body or his bat (if he's holding it) on the ground behind the line of the crease, then he cannot be run out (except if both batsmen are on the same side of a crease); frequently it is a close call whether or not a batsman ''gained his ground'' in this way before the bails were removed. (The difference between ''stumped'' and ''run out'' is that the wicketkeeper may stump a batsman who goes too far forward to play the ball, while any fielder, including the keeper, may run out a batsman who goes too far for any other purpose, including for taking a run.)
-->
击球手在[[三柱门|三柱门]]之间跑动（或比赛进行时离开区域线）时，若防守球员用球将任意柱门（set of stumps）上的横木移动，则该击球手（击球员或非击球员皆可）出局。离被移去横木的柱门最近的击球手如果不在安全区域，他将被判出局。如果击球手身体任意部分或他的球板（必须手持）接触区域线后的地面，那么他不能被截杀（除非两名击球手在区域线的同侧）；通常，击球手是否在横木被移去之前如此“触地”均是差之毫厘。（

===规则39：击杀===
<!--If the striker steps in front of the [[crease_(cricket)|crease]] to play the ball, leaving no part of his anatomy or the bat on the ground behind the crease, and the [[wicket-keeper|wicket-keeper]] is able to remove the bails from the wicket with the ball, then the striker is out.

''See [[stump_(cricket)|stump]] for more information.''
-->
如果击球员向前迈出[[区域线|区域线]]击球，使得他的身体任何部分或球板都没有接触区域线之后的地面，而此时[[守门手_(板球)|守门手]]用球将三柱门上的横木移去，则该击球员出局。击杀和追杀的区别是：捕手可以将击球迈步向前过头的击球手击杀；而任何防守球员，包括守门手都可以将因任何目的，如跑位中，离开安全区的击球手被追截杀出局。）
