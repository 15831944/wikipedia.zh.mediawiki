<!-- Like the [[Upper_East_Side|Upper East Side]], the Upper West Side is primarily a residential and shopping area, with many of its residents working in more commercial areas in [[Midtown_Manhattan|Midtown]] and [[Lower_Manhattan|Lower Manhattan]]. While these distinctions were never hard-and-fast rules, and now mean little, it has the reputation of being home to New York City's [[liberal|liberal]] cultural and artistic workers, in contrast to the Upper East Side, which is perceived to be traditionally home to more [[conservatism|conservative]] commercial and business types. The neighborhood is rather upscale with the median household income in many areas exceeding Manhattan average to a considerable extent. [[File:Restaurant.jpg|thumb]], at West 112th Street and [[Broadway_(Manhattan)|Broadway]], was used as the establishing shot for "Monk's Cafe" on ''[[Seinfeld|Seinfeld]]'', a program that was set on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. [[Suzanne_Vega|Suzanne Vega]]'s song "[[Tom's_Diner|Tom's Diner]]" is another famous reference.]] -->

上西区南到59街，东到[[中央公园|中央公园]]，西到[[哈德逊河|哈德逊河]]，北面的边界不太明显，历史上曾经是110街，完全毗邻中央公园，但现在经常认为是125街，就包括了[[晨边高地|晨边高地]]在内。 <ref>[Waxman, Sarah. [http://www.ny.com/articles/upperwest.html "The History of the Upper West Side"], NY.com. Acecssed 2007-07-07. "Home to such venerable New York landmarks as Lincoln Center, Columbia University, the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, the Dakota Apartments, and Zabar's food emporium, the Upper West Side stretches from 59th Street to 125th Street, including Morningside Heights. It is bounded by Central Park on the east and the Hudson River on the west."</ref><!-- This reflects demographic shifts in Morningside Heights, as well as the tendency of real estate brokers to co-opt the tony Upper West Side name when listing 晨边高地apartments. -->

自西向东，上西区的大道有河滨大道（第十一大道）、[[百老汇|百老汇]]、阿姆斯特丹大道（第十大道）、哥伦布大道（第九大道）、曼哈顿大道和中央公园西（第八大道）。<!-- The 66-block stretch of Broadway forms the spine of the neighborhood and moves diagonally across the avenues at the bottom of the neighborhood and above 72nd Street moves parallel to the avenues; it enters the neighborhood at its juncture with Central Park West at [[Columbus_Circle|Columbus Circle]] (59th Street), crosses Columbus Ave. at [[Lincoln_Square|Lincoln Square]] (65th Street), crosses Amsterdam Ave. at [[Verdi_Square|Verdi Square]] (72nd Street), and then merges with West End at [[Straus_Square|Straus Square]] (aka Bloomingdale Square, at 107th Street). -->

<!-- Traditionally the neighborhood ranged from the former village of Harsenville, centered on the old Bloomingdale Road (now [[Broadway_(New_York_City)|Broadway]]) and [[65街,_west_to_the_railroad_yards_along_the_Hudson,_then_north_to_110th_Street,_where_the_ground_rises_to_晨边高地。_With_the_building_of_[[Lincoln_Center|65街, west to the railroad yards along the Hudson, then north to 110th Street, where the ground rises to 晨边高地。 With the building of [[Lincoln Center]], its name, though perhaps not the reality, was stretched south to 59th Street. With the arrival of the corporate headquarters and expensive condos of the [[Time_Warner_Center|Time Warner Center]] at Columbus Circle, and the Riverside South apartment complex built by [[Donald_Trump|Donald Trump]], the area 从59街到65街 is increasingly referred to as Lincoln Square by realtors who acknowledge a different tone and ambiance than that typically associated with the Upper West Side. -->

== 历史 ==
<!-- Originally the name Bloomingdale (from the Dutch "Bloemendaal"), or the Bloomingdale District, applied to the west side of Manhattan from about [[23rd_Street_(Manhattan)|23rd Street]] up to the Hollow Way (modern 125th Street), and it contained numerous farms and country residences of many of the city's well-off. The main artery of this area was the Bloomingdale Road, which began north of where Broadway and the Bowery Lane join (at modern [[Union_Square_(New_York_City)|Union Square]]) and wended its way northward up to about modern 116th Street in Morningside Heights, where the road further north was known as the Kingsbridge Road. Within the confines of the modern-day Upper West Side, the road passed through areas known as Harsenville, Strycker's Bay, and Bloomingdale Village.

In the eighteenth and early nineteenth century, the Upper West Side-to-be contained some of colonial New York's most ambitious houses, spaced along Bloomingdale Road. It became increasingly infilled with smaller, more suburban villas in the first half of the nineteenth century, and in the middle of the century, parts had become decidedly lower class. The [[Hudson_River_Railroad|Hudson River Railroad]] line [[right-of-way_(railroad)|right-of-way]], granted in the late 1830s, soon ran along the riverbank, and creation of the Central Park caused many squatters to move their shacks westward into the UWS. Parts of the neighborhood became a ragtag collection of squatters' housing, boarding houses, and rowdy taverns. -->

<!-- As this development occurred, the old name of Bloomingdale Road was being chopped away and the name Broadway was progressively being applied further northward to include what had been lower Bloomingdale Road. In 1868, the city began straightening and grading the section of the Bloomingdale Road from Harsenville north, and it became known as "The Boulevard". It retained that name until the end of the century, when the name Broadway finally supplanted it.

Development of the neighborhood lagged even while Central Park was being laid out in the 1860s and 70s, then was stymied by the [[Panic_of_1873|Panic of 1873]]. Things turned around when the elevated train's rapid transit was extended up Ninth Avenue (renamed Columbus Avenue in 1890), and with Columbia University's relocation to [[Morningside_Heights|Morningside Heights]] in the 1890s, using lands once held by the Bloomingdale Asylum. The Upper West Side was built in a boom from 1885 to 1910, thanks in large part to the arrival of IRT subway stations at 72nd, 79th, 86th and 96th Street after 1904.

In the early part of the 1900s, the Upper West Side area south of 67th Street was heavily populated by [[African-American|African-American]]s and supposedly gained its nickname of "[[San_Juan_Hill,_Manhattan|San Juan Hill]]" in commemoration of African-American soldiers who were a major part of the assault on [[Cuba|Cuba]]'s [[San_Juan_Hill|San Juan Hill]] in the [[Spanish-American_War|Spanish-American War]]. But by 1960, the area was a rough neighborhood of tenement housing and was used for exterior shots in the movie musical ''[[West_Side_Story_(film)|West Side Story]]''. [[Urban_renewal|Urban renewal]] then swept through with the construction of the [[Lincoln_Center_for_the_Performing_Arts|Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts]] and [[Lincoln_Towers|Lincoln Towers]] apartments during 1962–1968. -->

<!-- [[Riverside_Park|Riverside Park]] was conceived by Central Park designer [[Frederick_Law_Olmsted|Frederick Law Olmsted]], as was the adjacent, gracefully curving [[Riverside_Drive|Riverside Drive]]. But the park came into its own only in the 1930s, when [[Robert_Moses|Robert Moses]] added playgrounds, promenades, distinctive stonework and the 79th Street boat basin. According to [[Robert_Caro|Robert Caro]]'s book, ''The Power Broker'' on Moses, Riverside Park was designed with most of the amenities located in predominately white neighborhoods, with the neighborhoods closer to Harlem getting shorter shrift.

From the post-WWII years until the AIDS epidemic the neighborhood, especially below 86th Street had a substantial gay population.  Theater people had been attracted to the neighborhood because of its proximity and easy transportation to the Theater District, and among these were many gay men.  As the neighborhood had deteriorated it was affordable to working class gay men, and those just arriving in NYC and looking for their first white collar jobs.  Its ethnically mixed gay population, mostly Hispanic and white, with a mixture of income levels and occupations patronized the same gay bars in the neighborhood, making it markedly different from most gay enclaves elsewhere in the city.  The influx of white gay men in the Fifties and Sixties is often credited with accelerating the gentrification of the Upper West Side, and by the mid and late 70's the gay male population had become predominantly white.

Another component that brought about the eventual gentrification of the neighborhood were the recent college graduates in the late '70s and early '80s who moved in, drawn to the neighborhood's large apartments and cheap housing. --> 

<!-- The Upper West Side is also a largely Jewish neighborhood, populated with both well-to-do German Jews who moved in at the turn of the century, and Jewish refugees escaping Hitler's Europe in the 1930's.

In a subsequent phase of urban renewal, the rail yards which had formed the Upper West Side's southwest corner were replaced by the [[Trump_Place|Riverside South]] residential project and a southward extension of Riverside Park. The evolution of Riverside South had a 40-year history, often extremely bitter, beginning in 1962 with the first proposal made by the Penn Railroad itself. The most ambitious proposal, and the one generating the most opposition was [[Donald_Trump|Donald Trump]]'s "Television City" concept of 1985, which would have included a 152-story tower. In 1991, civic groups signaled that they were willing to accept a development about 40% smaller in scope than Trump proposed, and things finally started moving. [[As_of_2005|As of 2005]] construction is well underway, but still to be resolved is the future of the West Side Highway viaduct over the park area.

The Bloomingdale district was the site for several long-established charitable institutions: their unbroken parcels of land have provided suitably-scaled sites for [[Columbia_University|Columbia University]] and the [[Cathedral_of_Saint_John_the_Divine,_New_York|Cathedral of Saint John the Divine]], as well as for some vanished landmarks, such as the [[Riverside_(house)|Schwab Mansion]] on [[Riverside_Drive_(New_York)|Riverside Drive]], the most ambitious free-standing private house ever built in Manhattan.

The name Bloomingdale is still used in reference to a part of the Upper West Side, essentially the location of old Bloomingdale Village, the area from about 96th Street up to 110th Street and from Riverside Park east to Amsterdam Ave. The triangular block bound by Broadway, West End Avenue, 106th Street and 107th Street, although generally known as Straus Park (named for [[Isidor_Straus|Isidor Straus]] and his wife Ida), was officially designated Bloomingdale Square in 1907. The neighborhood also includes the [[Bloomingdale_School_of_Music|Bloomingdale School of Music]] and Bloomingdale neighborhood branch of the [[New_York_Public_Library|New York Public Library]]. Adjacent to the Bloomingdale neighborhood is a neighborhood called [[Manhattan_Valley|Manhattan Valley]], focused on the downslope of Columbus Avenue and [[Manhattan_Avenue_(Manhattan)|Manhattan Avenue]] from about 102nd Street up to 110th Street. -->

<!-- == In film, television, and the arts ==
The Upper West Side has been a setting for many movies and television shows because of its pre-War architecture, colorful community and rich cultural life.  Ever since [[Edward_R._Murrow|Edward R.

[[Woody_Allen|Woody Allen]]'s film ''[[Hannah_and_Her_Sisters|Hannah and Her Sisters]]'' captures that quintessential Upper West Side flavor of rambling high-ceilinged apartments bursting at the seams with books and other cultural artifacts. -->

Another amusing sidelight relating to the local character of the movie was the scene in which the two principals enter a movie theater. The multiplex exists, and the sub-theater in which they go to watch the movie later showed ''You've Got Mail''.

* ''[[Mad_About_You|Mad About You]]'' - From [http://alumnus.caltech.edu/~witelski/may-faq3.html#3.5] : "When they met [1.11], Paul was living at 129 West 81st Street, and Jamie was living nearby at 142 West 81st, so it is understandable that they met at a local newsstand. They moved in together on [[Valentine's_Day|Valentine's Day]], 1991. Before moving into his own apartment on West 81st, Paul stayed for a while with his cousin Ira at 196 West 93rd Street [3.22], before Ira booted him out [3.16]. The actual building used for the exterior shots of their apartment together is located at the corner of East 12th st. and Fifth Avenue. We don't know for sure, but exterior shots for the registration episode [2.21] were filmed at [[Columbia_University|Columbia University]]. The building with the columns where registration takes place is Ferris Booth Hall (which has since been replaced by [[Alfred_Lerner_Hall|Alfred Lerner Hall]]), while the student centre and the outside shot after that is on one of the lower campus paths, looking south, with Ferris Booth to the right, [[Butler_Library|Butler Library]] to the left, and Carman Hall in the background right, with Carman Gate in the background. The message kiosk is in the foreground right."

The song's lyrics mention that they see the movie at a theater on 68th Street and [[Broadway_(New_York_City)|Broadway]]. While there is indeed an [[AMC_Theatres|AMC]] movie theater on that corner, the video shows them at a ticket booth for an entirely different theater (on 84th and Broadway).

Famous comedian [[George_Carlin|George Carlin]] grew up on 121st, and has drawn heavily upon his New York City roots on a number of his comedy albums, perhaps most memorably on ''[[Occupation:_Foole|Occupation: Foole]]'', where he says he and his friends called their neighborhood "White Harlem... because it sounded tough.  Its real name was Morningside Heights."
