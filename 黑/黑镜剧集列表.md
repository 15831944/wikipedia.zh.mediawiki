 |ShortSummary    = 本集的舞台設定在人类未來的社會，表現出人类對娛樂業的貪得無厭。在這個世界中，每個人都必須騎固定自行車發電，可以藉此賺到“點”這種貨幣。每個人都穿著灰色運動服，但可花費“點”讓代表自己的虛擬人像穿上色彩繽紛的衣服。每天，所有活動都會被插播廣告打斷，除非花費“點”，不然那些廣告是不能跳過或者可以忽略的。[[肥胖|肥胖]]的人被認為是二等公民，在機器附近當清潔工或是在娱乐节目中被侮辱。賓漢·麥德森（Bingham Madsen）在哥哥死後繼承了1,500萬點，可以自由跳過廣告。他偶然在洗手間聽到艾比（Abi）的歌聲，十分喜愛。麥德森鼓勵她進入類似《[[X音素|X音素]]》的選秀節目，這個節目給予人們逃脫他們奴隸般的生活的機會。艾比因害怕出醜而不願參加。麥德森覺得自己那麼多錢沒什麼可買，且自從他哥過世後，他就沒見過一件"真實"的事情發生，週遭事物都是虛假（虛擬）的。於是就用1,500萬點為她買了選秀節目的入場券，儘管她不太情願比賽。艾比在上台前事先服用了工作人員給的鎮靜藥水，表演結束後，評委和觀眾都喜歡她的歌聲，但評委說她的歌聲「僅高於平均水準的選手」，沒有機會成為歌手。評委給她一個機會，要么當色情演員，要么回去騎自行車。最後在評委和觀眾的煽動之下，她同意當色情演員。麥德森心碎了，認為是藥物控制了艾比。麥德森回到自己的房間，沒有了艾比也沒了點數。當艾比的色情節目在電視上播放時，麥德森沒錢跳過，就只得觀看。麥德森拼命要逃脫自己的房間，絕望中把玻璃牆打碎。他從玻璃碎片中選了一片收藏起來，開始努力工作，準備再賺1,500萬點的入場券費用進入比賽。他省吃儉用，撿別人剩下的食物，努力騎車。在入選前，他每天都面無表情地站在選秀節目的等候室。在登上舞台時，他像艾比一樣被要求服用鎮靜藥水，但他用從艾比表演時保存下的空杯子瞞過了主辦方。麥德森開始表演跳舞，卻在途中忽然拿出玻璃片抵著脖子，威脅評委在節目現場自殺。他哭訴制度是多麼不公平，因為評委帶走了自己在現實世界中唯一覺得真實的東西，並向他們表達憤怒。評委並沒有思考他說的話，而是認為他的「表演」很好，讓他創建了自己的電視節目，節目中他可以繼續哭訴現實。他知道自己在沒有服用藥水下神智是清醒的，但卻難以招架誘惑，沒有繼續反對制度而是選擇接受。他在自己的閣樓中，將玻璃片放入絲綢中保存。節目的最後，麥德森盯著巨大的玻璃牆，牆外是廣袤的森林。留給觀眾思考，他到底是在看窗戶還只是一塊更大的電腦屏幕。他是否只是被升級到大一點的房間？<!-- Bing feels trapped living in an enclosed, automated space, as a member of a society that rides power-generating stationary bikes in exchange for "merits", a form of currency they can use to buy things they need. One day, he hears a girl named Abi singing in the bathroom and falls in love with her. He decides to gift her fifteen million merits, that she can use to buy a ticket for a talent show. Abi accepts and enters the contest, where she is given a [[Psychoactive_drug|psychotropic]] beverage to drink before she goes on stage. The judges are impressed with her singing, but they suggest she is better suited for pornography. Abi accepts their offer, unable to think clearly. Bing returns to the stationary bikes, determined to earn back the merits he needs to enter the contest himself, and finally manages to buy a new ticket. When he enters the stage, he takes the opportunity to express his indignation and threatens to commit suicide, while other members are watching in the audience. When he finishes talking, the judges offer him a weekly show, where he will have the opportunity to rant about the system. Bing accepts their offer. -->

 |ShortSummary    = 年轻律师連恩·福斯威爾（Liam Foxwell）接受了一项工作评估，感觉自己做得不好。会议結束后，他重新回顧一下記憶，仔细思考老闆的谎言。他參加了一项妻子朋友主办的晚宴，看到妻子菲恩（Fi）在與一个他不认识的人谈话，名叫乔纳斯（Jonas）。妻子的部分朋友询问评估进行的怎样，建议“重放”一下，可以给些建议。乔纳斯站出来给連恩解了围。晚餐中，乔纳斯坦白地谈论自己的个人生活，谈到了自己用“重放”过去的爱情生活手淫。連恩對妻子在晚餐的过程中觀察乔纳斯的样子怀疑，尤其怀疑妻子在乔纳斯讲冷笑话时的大笑。連恩和妻子回到家后，發現妻子曾与乔纳斯多年前有一段感情。她最开始说那持续了一周，之后说一个月，之后承认有半年。这些改口让連恩更加怀疑妻子。他重放了晚餐的录像，要求菲恩解释为什么。菲恩对丈夫刻薄的提问越发难受，談話变成了争吵。連恩道歉，然后开始做爱，但都是通过看过去的激烈性爱录像助兴。结束之后，連恩走下楼，回看乔纳斯那晚的坦诚谈话，之后借酒消愁。他喝了一晚上，第二天早晨想起妻子和乔纳斯冷笑话的举动，继续与妻子争吵。連恩酒后驾车到乔纳斯的房子，进行对峙，威胁乔纳斯如果不删除关于妻子的记忆，就挖出乔纳斯的记忆颗粒。乔纳斯答应了，連恩开车回家，车撞倒了树上，失去知觉。当連恩醒来，重放自己的最新记忆，越放越难受，準備回家与妻子对峙——恰巧回放到乔纳斯删除关于妻子的记忆时墙上播放的片段，其中的一份文件證明，妻子和乔纳斯在18個月前发生过性关系——那正是妻子要怀女儿之时。妻子承认对連恩撒了谎，说那是在他吵架出走后，用了避孕套後才偷情的，連恩才是女儿的父亲。連恩不相信，要求妻子播放記憶证明它。她试图抹掉这段記憶，連恩阻止了她。播放录像时，妻子哭泣、不敢面对屏幕。节目没有解開录像是否证明了丈夫正确的答案，但强烈暗示了連恩是正确的。在节目最后，連恩在房子里来回走动，衣冠不整，精神憔悴。此时，妻子和女儿已经离开了。連恩走进他们曾经的房间时，妻子和女儿的快乐记忆在連恩眼前重放。連恩最后徒手用剃刀把记忆颗粒从脖子挖出。<!-- People have implanted a "grain" behind their ear, which allows them to record everything they see and hear. Using a remote, a user can perform a "re-do", playing back their memories directly to their eye or to a video monitor. At a dinner party, Liam is suspicious of his wife Fi's behaviour towards a man named Jonas. Returning home, Fi admits that she used to be in a relationship with him. The next morning, Liam drunkenly heads to Jonas' house and forces him to delete every memory of sexual intercourse he had with Fi. In the memories appearing on the monitor, Liam notices one from the time when he and Fi were already in a relationship. Li, afraid that he might not be the biological father of his child, returns home and demands that Fi show him the re-do of that specific sexual encounter, in order to prove that they had used a condom. The re-do verifies that the two of them had unprotected sex. Sometime later, having been left alone in his house, Li goes to the bathroom and uses a razor blade to cut out the grain from behind his ear.-->

 |ShortSummary    = 年轻夫妇玛莎（Martha）和艾許（Ash）搬到了郊区。丈夫艾許是一个社交网站迷，在手机上频繁地查看社交网站更新。他们搬家的第二天，艾許就因交通事故身亡。葬礼上，玛莎的朋友莎拉（Sarah）向她推荐了一个新的网络服务，此服务通过分析逝者的网络通讯，模拟人们与已经离世者保持通讯。虽然玛莎一开始拒绝，但莎拉还是注册了服务。于是，虚拟的艾許就被建立了。它向玛莎发了一封邮件，玛莎因此对莎拉十分气愤，而在莎拉的再三建议下，玛莎开始尝试使用此服务。后来几天，玛莎沉浸在失去丈夫的悲伤中，这时她发现自己已经怀孕了。由于情绪变得不稳定，她开始回应虚拟艾許的邮件。她通过[[即時通訊|即時通訊]]软件，告诉了他自己怀孕的消息。之后，她开始向服务数据库上传艾許的视频与照片，此服务虚拟艾許的声音与玛莎通话。玛莎强迫自己相信对话的人就是死去的丈夫。在后面的几个星期里，玛莎不断地与艾許对话，谈论玛莎的怀孕。一次，玛莎不小心摔坏电话，由于与服务临时失去了联系，她恐慌症发作。此时，艾許告诉她可以使用一个还处在试验阶段的服务：人造躯体的艾許。玛莎向服务提供商购买了一个空白的人造躯体，此躯体模仿了艾許的身体特征。改造完之后，几乎完整複製了艾許，区别只是复制阿什的脸部缺少毛发，脖子上没有痣。复制的艾許令玛莎感到不安，但依然努力去接受这个艾許复制人。玛莎对艾許复制人的性能力感到满足，但很快对复制人艾許与真艾許的区别感到失意：复制人艾許对玛莎有求必应、缺乏情感（只有被玛莎要求时才会表达情感）、缺乏真人的习惯与性格。争吵之后，玛莎认为自己忍受不了复制人艾許，把他带到悬崖边，让他跳下去。复制人艾許同意这样做，但是玛莎因此变得更生气了，实际上艾許不会跳。复制人艾許于是向玛莎求救，导致玛莎意识到，自己是离不开这个複製人的。镜头切换到数年后，此时玛莎的女儿已经长大，复制人艾許被玛莎锁在阁楼里。玛莎允许女儿在周末见复制人艾許，但生日时女儿要求到阁楼给他一块生日蛋糕。女儿与复制人艾許在阁楼时，玛莎在楼梯下等候，几乎落泪。<!-- Ash lives with his girlfriend Martha, spending a lot of time on social media, until one day he dies in a traffic accident. A few days later, Martha finds out that she is pregnant and decides to use a new technology that is able to simulate Ash's voice and personality on the phone, based on his social media profile and other audiovisual material. This service helps her overcome her despair, until one day she accidentally drops her phone and panics. The artificial Ash tells her of the service's experimental stage, in which she agrees to have the replica transferred into a synthetic body, almost identical to Ash. However, Martha realises that the android is not able to replicate the small details in her loved one's behaviour and starts distancing herself from it. Finally, Martha takes the artificial Ash to a cliff and orders it to jump off. As it begins to follow the order, Martha expresses her frustration that Ash would not have simply obeyed. As a response, the android starts begging for its life. Unable to get rid of it, she ends up keeping the android in the attic, where a few years later her little daughter visits it every weekend.-->

 |ShortSummary    = 一间卧室里，一名名叫維多莉亞·史基蘭的女子醒来，发现自己正坐在椅子上，失去了任何关于自己经历的记忆。这明显是自杀未果造成的，維多莉亞发现自己满脑子都缠绕着一名名叫潔邁瑪的小女孩（她猜测是自己的女儿）和一名未知男子的画面。維多莉亞看到电视屏幕上有一个奇怪的标志，日历翻到了10月，18日之前的日期都被圈起来了。维多利亚离开家，发现人们都在用自己的手机拍摄她，于是她寻求帮助，并且朝着录影者喊叫，叫他们停止录影时，一个戴着有奇怪标志的巴拉克拉法帽的男人停下车，戴着一把枪出来，朝维多利亚开火。在逃跑过程中，維多莉亞遇到了正在寻找食物的潔姆和達米安。为了拯救維多莉亞和潔姆，達米安被那个戴面具的男人杀死，使得他们不得不继续逃跑。潔姆解释道，那个标志表示一座叫「白熊」的信号塔，此塔发射的信号把人们变成只会录像的看客。維多莉亞和潔姆没被信号影响，但成为这些像那个带面具的“「猎人」的目标。潔姆计划去信号塔，摧毁信号发射。行进过程中，維多莉亞和潔姆被一个叫做巴克斯特的人接走，此人也没有被信号影响，但把他们带到一座森林并且把槍口对准他们。潔姆设法脱身后，維多莉亞被绑在了一颗树上，准备被男人折磨。此时，潔姆回来杀死了巴克斯特。他们继续旅行到发射塔，此时維多莉亞开始回忆起过去与未来发生的事情。当他们到达白熊发射塔准备摧毁它时，維多莉亞与潔姆被两个猎人袭击。维多利亚成功地抢到了一把枪，并对猎人开枪——但枪只发射出五彩纸屑。幕墙打开了，观众在观看完这个恶作剧后鼓掌；潔姆、達米安和猎手被揭示一直是表演的一部分。维多利亚被用皮带捆在椅子上，巴克斯特出现了，揭示了一切：維多莉亞猜测是自己女儿的那个女孩实际上是六岁小学生潔邁瑪·赛克斯，維多莉亞和她的未婚夫伊恩·兰诺克诱拐了她到一个森林。伊恩对她进行了折磨，并且杀害了她。維多莉亞用自己的手机记录了这一切。受害者的[[泰迪熊|泰迪熊]]“白熊”，成为全国范围内搜查凶手和进行谋杀调查的代号。維多莉亞的录像足以证明是她的未婚夫（在审判前于监狱中自杀）进行杀人。維多莉亞痛哭流涕地认罪，并且说是在「伊恩的迷惑下」犯下罪行。法官判处维多利亚「合适且经深思熟虑的」的刑罚：每天都经过这个手机录制的、具有想象力的惩罚。虽然仍然对之前的事情没有清楚的记忆，維多莉亞被在谴责她的人群（在员工的煽动下）中游街，最后回到了她醒来的房间中。她被巴克斯特放回那个早晨醒来的椅子上，此时她的眼睛中浮现了杰姆的片段，然后巴克斯特将电极插到他的脑袋上，抹除維多莉亞的当日记忆。抹除时維多莉亞痛苦挣扎地吼叫。巴克斯特离开卧室，在日历上10月18日的格子中打上叉，做好准备让維多莉亞明天重复经历相同的事件。在播放片尾字幕时，可以看到「白熊正义公园」的员工（包括巴克斯特、潔姆和達米安），准备下一天的表演，以及如何布景，等「花絮」。那些用手机拍摄的看客实际是公园的游客，来观看维多利亚受难。故事的末尾重复了开头：維多莉亞在卧室椅子上醒来，失去记忆。<!-- A woman wakes up in a house with amnesia. She notices people on the street recording her on their phones, but when she speaks to them they ignore her. When a masked man opens fire at her with a shotgun, she flees and meets Jem, another woman running away from the "hunters". Jem explains that the people recording her have been affected by a signal that appeared on their screens, while the hunters are unaffected people acting sadistically. The woman follows Jem in her plan to reach the transmitter and destroy it. When they reach the facilities, they are attacked by two more hunters. The woman manages to wrestle a shotgun away, but when she pulls the trigger it only sprays confetti, revealing that everything was staged. The woman is told that her name is Victoria Skillane and she has been found guilty for her part in the brutal killing of a young girl. She has been sentenced to undergo this psychological torture daily in the "White Bear Justice Park", where visitors are allowed to record her daily suffering. Victoria is returned to the house where she awoke and has her memory of the day's events wiped clean, in an extremely painful procedure. -->

 |ShortSummary    = 傑米·史雷特（{{Le|丹尼爾·瑞格比|Daniel Rigby}}飾）是位失志的喜劇演員，負責一隻藍色卡通熊瓦爾多的配音及動作操控，訪問政治及權威人物。受訪者被誤導以為瓦爾多熊的訪談是兒童電視節目一部分，但事實上這是一個深夜的政治諷刺秀。瓦爾多熊深受英國大眾歡迎，甚至有個牠專屬的衍生節目正在洽談中，但即使面對角色大紅，傑米仍然對他的生活感到沮喪及不滿足。
在一次節目構思的腦力激盪中，擁有版權的製作人傑克·納皮爾（[[傑森·弗萊明|傑森·弗萊明]]飾）半開玩笑地建議瓦爾多熊應該與其他真人一同參選鎮上緊接而來的大選，如此一來他可以對抗過去的受訪者——保守黨候選人連恩·摩爾（[[托比亞·曼齊司|托比亞·曼齊司]]飾）。製作公司展開了競選活動，將瓦爾多熊投射在貨車側身的大螢幕上並尾隨摩爾的任何活動，讓沃德熊可以公開羞辱他。傑米一開始反對這主意，擔心涉入政治，但還是勉強接受，並配合該計畫。在競選活動中，傑米遇見了純粹為推長自己的政治生涯而加入工黨補選的參選人關朵琳。兩人越走越近並發生了一夜情，但事後關朵琳接獲顧問警告，要求她在競選期間與傑米保持距離。傑米不明白為何她突然開始疏遠，內心更加蔑視職業政客。一次邀請所有候選人出席的談話節目上，摩爾嘲笑瓦爾多熊與傑米，諷刺瓦爾多熊是個大笑話、而傑米自己本身在演藝生涯沒有任何成就。這惹惱了傑米，他開始憤怒地責罵現場所有候選人，指控他們比瓦爾多熊還虛假，爆料關朵琳不過是個職業政客，並指出大眾已經對政治人物失去信心。傑米事後非常懊悔自己的失控，但這番大放厥詞在[[YouTube|YouTube]]上大受歡迎並讓瓦爾多熊獲得更多支持。傑米和製作人傑克與一名自稱為經紀人的美國男子見面，他表示瓦爾多熊的獨立形象有成為全球性象徵的潛力，這讓傑米更加不屑。於是在一次激烈的爭吵後，傑米選擇離開競選活動。他嘗試去向關朵琳為自己的行為道歉，但她拒絕，無法原諒他對自己的政治生涯造成了永久性傷害。在競選活動的最後一天，傑米再次加入，但遭罪惡感驅使，而在一場活動上崩潰，開始懇求大眾不要投給瓦爾多熊，並離開貨車開始破壞大螢幕。制作人傑克隨即控制瓦爾多熊，並教唆大眾攻擊傑米。大選之日，傑米從醫院的病床上觀看結果：摩爾贏了選戰、瓦爾多熊（現在由製作人傑克配音）第二、關朵琳第三。傑克甚至慫恿觀眾對摩爾發動擲鞋攻擊。在片尾，傑米已經變成了無家可歸的流浪漢，他在街上的螢幕裡看見瓦爾多熊已經成了全球性組織，並推出多語廣告。他憤怒地將瓶子砸向螢幕，因此遭到兩名警察攻擊。 <!-- Jamie Salter is a comedian controlling a vulgar computer-animated bear named Waldo on a late-night show. The character becomes popular with the British public and a pilot for a series is commissioned. Jamie reluctantly agrees to have Waldo enter an upcoming by-election to promote the pilot, having no interest in politics himself. Waldo is projected onto a screen on the side of a van and targets the Conservative candidate Liam Monroe by following him around during his campaign. Jamie sleeps with the Labour candidate Gwendolyn Harris, with whom he starts falling in love. When Gwendolyn follows her campaign manager's advice and distances herself from Jamie, he exposes her publicly as a career politician. Waldo gains more public support, attracting American interest for global branding, but Jamie rejects the idea. On the final day of the campaign trail, Jamie begs the public not to vote for Waldo. Monroe wins the election, with Waldo coming second and Gwendolyn third.

 |ShortSummary    = 在偏僻的冰雪荒野中，兩個男人在小木屋裡娓娓道來三個發生在聖誕佳節期間，互有關連的科技失控故事。<!-- On Christmas Day, Matt and Joe start talking about their past for the first time, after five years that they have been stationed together in a remote cabin. Matt used to help single men seduce women. His clients had optical implants that allowed him to see through their eyes and give them advice in real-time using the "Eye-Link" technology. His main profession, however, was subjugating artificial copies of clients' consciousness, stored into bean-sized chips called "cookies", into docile personal assistants in charge of running smart houses. Joe reveals that after a domestic squabble, his pregnant girlfriend Beth "blocked" him, using a technology that turned them into incomprehensible pixelated blurs to each other. The block lasted for years, preventing him from talking to Beth or the child, until Beth died in an accident. Joe found the child in Beth's father's cabin, but the man told him that the little girl was not his daughter. Angered, Joe bashed his head with an object and left. After Joe tells Matt that the girl also died in the blizzard, trying to get help for her grandfather, it is revealed that everything is taking place inside Joe's cookie, where Matt was trying to extract Joe's confession, in exchange for his own release from prison. Due to his Eye-Link-related voyeurism, Matt is registered as a sex offender, resulting in him being universally blocked following his release. Joe's artificial consciousness remains trapped in the cabin, having its time perception changed to 1,000 years a minute. -->

This system cultivates insincere relationships, as a person's rating significantly affects their socioeconomic status. Lacie is a young woman currently rated at 4.2 and keen to achieve self-improvement, hoping to reach a 4.5 rating to qualify for a discount to a luxury apartment. Lacie tries to gain favour from highly-rated people, as they have larger impacts on scores, and sees a great chance to achieve her goal, when school friend Naomi asks her to be maid-of-honour at her upcoming wedding, with many highly-rated guests. After a series of mishaps on her way to the wedding that send her ratings plummeting, Naomi calls Lacie and tells her not to come. Enraged, Lacie manages to get to the celebratory dinner; she grabs the microphone and starts giving the speech she had written. The guests rate her negatively, causing her rating to drop to zero. She becomes dangerously upset and security removes her from the area. She is placed in a cell and has the technology supporting the rating system removed from her eyes. Feeling liberated, she gets into an argument with a man, without worrying about being rated. -->

He avoids calling his mother for help, as he has been unable to connect with her following his father's death due to [[Early-onset_Alzheimer's_disease|early-onset Alzheimer's]]. While staying at the house of a girl he had slept with the previous night, Cooper offers to participate in a playtest of an augmented reality video game. A gadget with the ability to layer lifelike images and sounds into his perception is implanted at the back of his neck, though a phone call from his mother causes an [[Interference_(communication)|interference]] during the initialisation process. After the gadget probes his brain for information on things that scare him, the test begins with Cooper being left alone in a spooky mansion. There, Cooper endures some jumpscares at first, but when he later experiences severe mental and physical pain the test is terminated. Cooper returns home to his mother, who does not recognise him, and he realises that—like his father—she too has been afflicted with Alzheimer's. At this point, it is revealed that all events subsequent to the signal interference were taking place in Cooper's head. The interference had caused his brain synapses to light up all at once, resulting in his death shortly afterwards. -->

When soldier Stripe encounters several aggressive roaches, one of them uses a mysterious device that disrupts his MASS interface. The next day, Stripe starts seeing roaches as humans, and tries to save a frightened woman from his fellow female soldier, Hunter. The woman tells him that MASS disguises the fact that roaches are regular humans, hated by everyday civilians due to propaganda and prejudice. Hunter knocks Stripe unconscious and brings him back to the military base, where he is incarcerated. An officer named Arquette reveals to him that the true purpose of the MASS implants is to dehumanise the enemy, allowing soldiers to kill them more efficiently, as part of a eugenics program. Arquette threatens to imprison Stripe, endlessly looping raw footage of him killing ordinary humans during his service, unless he consents to have his MASS system reset. In the future, Stripe returns home and sees a beautiful woman waiting for him, but this is revealed to be a figment created by the MASS implant. -->

Detectives Karin Parke and Blue Coulson, together with the help of [[National_Crime_Agency|NCA]] agent Shaun Li, discover that hacked ADIs have caused the deaths of two people by getting inside their heads, causing unbearable pain. Coulson finds that the two victims had been targeted with the "#DeathTo" hashtag on social media, as part of the "Game of Consequences", where the person that leads the hashtag tables is killed every day. After a third person is killed, the hashtag starts rapidly growing in use. The analysis of the compromised ADIs proves the hacker to be former Granular employee Garrett Scholes. Police raid his location, yielding a disk drive that contains a list of every person who has used the hashtag. Parke concludes that these people are Scholes' real targets. Agent Li deactivates the system to bounce the hacker out, but when it comes back online, swarms of ADIs target a total of 387,036 people, resulting in a tremendous massacre. Sometime later, Parke is summoned to a hearing, where she talks about her involvement in the case. Coulson, who is presumed to have committed suicide, finds Scholes abroad and texts Parke "Got him". -->

Rolo shows Nish the star attraction of the museum, a holographic representation of the consciousness of convicted murderer Clayton Leigh that Rolo bought just prior to his electrocution, allowing visitors to electrocute him repeatedly. Nish reveals that her visit was not incidental, as she is the daughter of Clayton, who was wrongfully convicted. After poisoning Rolo, Nish transfers Rolo's consciousness into Clayton's head, much like Carrie was transferred into Jack's head, forcing him to live through the last electrocution which overloads Clayton's synapses and wipes the digital copies of them both. Rolo's agony is captured in a souvenir keychain which Nish takes along with the doll with Carrie's consciousness and shorts out the museum's electricity, starting a fire. Nish drives off with her mother, her consciousness living within Nish, tells her Clayton would be proud of her.  -->

 |ShortSummary    = 年轻的程序员史戴分·巴特勒开始开发一个名为《潘达斯奈基》的冒险类电脑游戏，该游戏基于同名的“选择自己的冒险”一书。他将游戏交给了为电脑游戏公司塔克软件工作的莫汗·塔克尔分发，而斯蒂芬则独自在家中完成游戏。斯蒂芬开始觉得自己受到控制，并同样以书籍作者傑洛姆·F·戴维斯所做的方式陷入疯狂。观众可为他做出选择，这可能使他与他的治疗师讨论他母亲的死亡、与游戏开发者科林·里特曼一起服用致幻剂、杀死他的父亲彼得、杀死塔克尔或体验不同的梦境等等。
