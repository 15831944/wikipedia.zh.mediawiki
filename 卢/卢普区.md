'''洛普區'''（{{lang-en|'''The Loop'''}}）是[[美國|美國]][[芝加哥|芝加哥]]的[[中央商務區|中央商務區]]、同時也是芝加哥77個{{link-en|芝加哥行政區劃|Community areas in Chicago|行政區}}之一，為美国第二大中央商务区，仅次于纽约[[中城_(纽约曼哈顿)|曼哈顿中城]]。西面和北面到[[芝加哥河|芝加哥河]]，东到[[密歇根湖|密歇根湖]]，南到{{link-en|羅斯福路 (芝加哥)|Roosevelt Road (Chicago)|罗斯福路}}。这里地价很高，因而建筑风格以高层为主。著名建筑有世界第一幢摩天大楼[[家庭保险大楼|家庭保险大楼]]、[[芝加哥期货交易所大楼|芝加哥期货交易所大楼]]、前美国第一高楼[[韋萊集團大廈|韋萊集團大廈]]（原西爾斯大廈）（Willis Tower/ex-Sears Tower）。<!-- 由于高层建筑的发展，该区的一些历史建筑 were instrumental。 -->芝加哥的{{link-en|芝加哥公路|Roads and expressways in Chicago|街道命名系统}}即以洛普區的[[州街_(芝加哥)|州街]]（State Street）及{{link-en|麥迪遜街 (芝加哥)|Madison Street (Chicago)|麥迪遜街}}（Madison Street）的交叉口为基点。

洛普區的英文原名「The Loop」意為環狀或環線，來自於1882年起在芝加哥市中心以環線運行的兩條[[街車|街車]]路線<ref>[http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/764.html The Loop]. Encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org. Retrieved on 2013-07-21.</ref><ref>[http://www.cable-car-guy.com/html/ccchi.html Joe Thompson, ''Cable Car Lines in Chicago'']</ref>。另外也有研究指出「The Loop」名稱直到{{link-en|芝加哥地鐵環線|The Loop (CTA)}}於1895年至1897年分段通車後，才逐漸為芝加哥市民所用<ref>{{cite news|first=Patrick T.|last=Reardon|title=It all starts downtown|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-07-26/features/0407260184_1_south-loop-cable-cars-chicago-transit-authority|work=[[Chicago_Tribune|Chicago Tribune]]|date=2004-07-26|access-date=2016-12-17}}</ref>。

== 地理 ==

洛普區西面和北面至芝加哥河，南面到罗斯福路，东面到密歇根湖。最初的边界局限于[[芝加哥軌道交通|高架鐵路]]（即今天的[[芝加哥捷運|CTA捷運系統]]）环绕的区域。不过，由于过去一段时期，市中心区域和许多高层伸展到正式行政区以外，“洛普區”也更多地用来表示整个市中心而不仅仅是正式行政区。<!-- The term even more specifically applies to the section of the community area surrounded by [[The_Loop_(rapid_transit)|circuit]] formed by [[Chicago_'L'|Chicago's 'L' trains]]. The circuit runs along北到Lake Street，东到Wabash Avenue，南到Van Buren街，西到Wells Street。The name, however, predates the elevated loop, 来自于[[电车|电车]] loop in [[1882|1882]]。目前，大多数居民认为洛普區的范围是以芝加哥河为北界和西界，以议会街为南界，哥伦布 Drive 为东界。

该区域拥有众多的购物选择，although it competes with the more upscale [[华丽一英里|华丽一英里]] area to the north, and with [[suburb|suburb]]an [[shopping_mall|shopping mall]]s.包括芝加哥著名的[[Marshall_Field's|Marshall Field's]] [[百货公司|百货公司]], now Macy's, a traditional favorite for viewing [[圣诞节|圣诞节]] window displays, and the original [[Carson_Pirie_Scott|Carson Pirie Scott]] store (closed February 21, 2007). -->

这里拥有许多政府大楼，包括市政厅、<!-- [[James_R._Thompson_Center|James R. Thompson Center]],[[Richard_J._Daley_Center|Richard J. Daley Center]], and multiple federal buildings. -->在这一区域还有芝加哥市中心剧院区，以及众多的[[餐馆|餐馆]]和[[旅馆|旅馆]]。

芝加哥拥有非常出名的[[天际线|天际线]]，有许多世界上最高的大厦。与过度拥挤的[[中城_(纽约曼哈顿)|曼哈顿中城]]不同，芝加哥整个市中心区域的天际线错落有致，呈现出优美的曲线。[[西尔斯大厦|西尔斯大厦]]是美国最高的大楼，位于卢普区的西端，该市金融区的心脏，这里还有其他许多大厦，例如伟基河畔南311号（311 South Wacker Drive）和美国电话电报企业中心（AT&T Corporate Center）。芝加哥第二高建筑—怡安中心（Aon Center）位于伊利诺斯中心周围，位于卢普区的东端，[[密歇根大街_(芝加哥)|密歇根大道]]东侧。Two Prudential Plaza也位于此处，就在怡安中心西侧。该市的第三高建筑—[[约翰汉考克中心|约翰汉考克中心]]位于卢普区以北的主要商业区[[华丽一英里|华丽一英里]]。 水塔广场大厦（北密歇根大街900号）和花园大厦（Park Tower）都位于距离[[约翰汉考克中心|约翰汉考克中心]]一两个街区之内，构成令人震撼的摩天大楼群，甚至在卢普区本身也无可匹敌。虽然有人認為这一区域是市中心的一部分，但根据正式的行政区划，这里已经不属于卢普区，而是属于近北区。

根据2000年人口统计，洛普區居住人口為16,388人。

卢普区有[[芝加哥公立學校|芝加哥公立學校]]（Chicago Public Schools, CPS）的总部<ref>"[http://www.cps.edu/About_CPS/The_Board_of_Education/FinanceandAuditCommittee/Documents/FinanceAndAuditCommitteeMtgNotice.pdf FinanceAndAuditCommitteeMtgNotice.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120919222338/http://www.cps.edu/About_CPS/The_Board_of_Education/FinanceandAuditCommittee/Documents/FinanceAndAuditCommitteeMtgNotice.pdf |date=2012-09-19 }}." [[芝加哥公立學校|芝加哥公立學校]]. "[...]125 South Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois[...]"</ref>。<!-- More recently, 60602 was named by Forbes as the hottest zipcode in the country with upscale buildings such as [[The_Heritage_at_Millennium_Park|The Heritage at Millennium Park]](130 N. Garland) leading the way for other buildings such at Waterview Tower, The Legacy and Momo. The median sale price for residential real estate was $710,000 in 2005 according to Forbes.  The Loop contains a wealth of outdoor [[sculpture|sculpture]], including works by [[Pablo_Picasso|Pablo Picasso]], [[Joan_Miró|Joan Miró]], [[Marc_Chagall|Marc Chagall]], [[Alexander_Calder|Alexander Calder]], and [[Jean_Dubuffet|Jean Dubuffet]].  Chicago's cultural heavyweights, such as the [[Chicago_Art_Institute|Art Institute of Chicago]], the [[Goodman_Theatre|Goodman Theatre]], the [[Lyric_Opera_of_Chicago|Lyric Opera]] at the [[Civic_Opera_House|Civic Opera House]] building, and the [[Chicago_Symphony_Orchestra|Chicago Symphony Orchestra]], are also in this area, as is the historic [[Palmer_House|Palmer House Hilton]] hotel, found on East Monroe Street.

芝加哥的湖滨地带，从北到南几乎全部是休闲公园区域，features [[Grant_Park_(Chicago)|Grant Park]] in this downtown area.  Grant Park is the home of [[Buckingham_Fountain|Buckingham Fountain]], the [[James_Petrillo|Petrillo Bandshell]], the Grant Park Symphony (where free  [[concert|concert]]s can be enjoyed throughout the summer), and Chicago's annual two-week [[food|food]] orgy, the [[Taste_of_Chicago|Taste of Chicago]], where more than 3 million people "pig out".  A recent addition to Grant Park is the architecturally forward [[Millennium_Park|Millennium Park]], which opened in the summer of 2004, featuring a [[Frank_Gehry|Frank Gehry]] [[bandshell|bandshell]] along with the [[Anish_Kapoor|Anish Kapoor]] "Cloud Gate" sculpture and spanning what were formerly open railyards on the city's lakefront.

The Chicago River, which delineates the area, also provides entertainment and recreational opportunities, including the annual dyeing of the river green in honor of [[St._Patrick's_Day|St. Patrick's Day]].  Trips down the Chicago River, including architectural tours, by commercial boat are great favorites with both locals and tourists.

The area is served by its own newspaper, the Chicago Journal.

<!-- == Sub-Neighborhoods ==

=== New Eastside ===

New Eastside is a mixed-use district bordered by 西到密歇根大街，北到芝加哥河，南到Randolph街，东到湖滨大道Lake Shore Drive。It encompasses the entire [[Illinois_Center|Illinois Center]] and [[Lakeshore_East|Lakeshore East]] developments[http://img152.imageshack.us/img152/7858/lseneigh7jh.jpg], as well as separate developments like [[Aon_Center_(Chicago)|Aon Center]], Prudential Plaza, Park Millennium Condominium Building, Hyatt Regency Chicago, and the Fairmont Hotel. The area has a [[Multilevel_streets_in_Chicago|triple-level street system]] and is bisected by Columbus Drive.  Most of this district has been developed on land that was once used by the Illinois Central Railroad rail yards.  The early buildings in this district such as the [[Aon_Center|Aon Center]], [[One_Prudential_Plaza|One Prudential Plaza]] were among the first built using airspace rights.  They were built above the railyards.

The [[Multilevel_streets_in_Chicago|triple-level street system]] allows for trucks to mainly travel and make deliveries on the lower levels, keeping traffic to a minimum on the upper levels.

Upcoming buildings include AQUA, part of Lake Shore East, and the Manderin Oriental Hotel & Tower.  Construction has begun on both of these projects, with expected completion dates in 2009.

The New Eastside is served by the following [[Chicago_Public_Schools|Chicago Public Schools]] campuses: [http://www.ogdenschool.org/ Ogden School] and [[Wells_Community_Academy_High_School|Wells Community Academy High School]]. -->

<!-- === Printer's Row ===
'''[[Printer's_Row|Printer's Row]]''', 又称为Printing House Row,是-{zh-hans:卢普区;zh-hk:盧普區;zh-tw:洛普區;}-南部的一个社区，它的北界为Congress Parkway，南到Polk街，东到Plymouth Court，西到芝加哥河。The signature street is Dearborn Street where the annual Printer's Row Book Fair [http://www.printersrowbookfair.org/] is held. Originally, the buildings in this area were used by [[印刷|印刷]] and [[publisher|publishing]] businesses. Today, the buildings have mainly been converted into residential lofts. Part of Printer's Row is an official landmark district [http://www.ci.chi.il.us/Landmarks/P/PrintingHouseDistrict.html].

Printer's Row is zoned to the following [[Chicago_Public_Schools|Chicago Public Schools]] campuses: [http://www.sloopschool.com/ South Loop School] and [[Phillips_Academy_High_School|Phillips Academy High School]]. -->

<!-- === South Loop ===
Most of the area 议会街以南和芝加哥河以东, possibly excepting Printer's Row, is referred to as the South Loop. The southern boundary of the neighborhood is under debate.  While the southern boundary for the community area is Roosevelt Road, the term "South Loop" is often used to describe an area that extends as far south as 18th Street or Cermak Road.  Numerous shops south of 罗斯福路 with "South Loop" in their name hint that this more generous definition may be gaining recognition.

The more restrictively-defined area includes River City, the northern half of Dearborn Park, and portions of State Street, Wabash Avenue, and Michigan Avenue.  The more generous definitions would include the Central Station development, Dearborn Park II, the Prairie District, and even the northern growth of Chinatown.

The major landowner in the South Loop is [[Columbia_College_Chicago|Columbia College Chicago]], a private school that owns 15 buildings. Also to be found here is the [[National_Vietnam_Veterans_Art_Museum|National Vietnam Veterans Art Museum]], championed by Mayor Daley.

South Loop is zoned to the following [[Chicago_Public_Schools|Chicago Public Schools]] campuses: [http://www.sloopschool.com/ South Loop School] and [[Phillips_Academy_High_School|Phillips Academy High School]].  [[Jones_College_Prep_High_School|Jones College Prep High School]], which is a selective enrollment magnet school drawing students from the entire city, is also located in the South Loop.

Weather permitting, large scale flea-marketing takes place here. -->
