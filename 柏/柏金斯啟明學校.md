==歷史沿革==
<!--Founded in 1829, Perkins was the first school for the blind established in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.perkins.org/about-us/history/ |title=History |publisher=Perkins |date= |accessdate=April 15, 2014}}</ref> The school was originally named the '''New England Asylum for the Blind''' and was incorporated on March 2, 1829. The name was eventually changed to Perkins School For the Blind. [[John_Dix_Fisher|John Dix Fisher]] first considered the idea of a school for blind children based upon his visits to Paris at the [[Institut_National_des_Jeunes_Aveugles|National Institute for the Blind]] and was inspired to create such a school in Boston.<ref>French, Kimberly. Perkins School for the Blind. Charleston, SC: Arcadia, 2004. Print.  Page 7.</ref>

The school is named in honor of [[Thomas_Handasyd_Perkins|Thomas Handasyd Perkins]], one of the organization's incorporators and a [[Boston,_Massachusetts|Boston]] shipping merchant who began losing his sight at the time of establishment.  In 1833, the school outgrew the Pleasant Street house of the father of its founder [[Samuel_Gridley_Howe|Samuel Gridley Howe]], and Perkins donated his Pearl Street mansion as the school's second home. In 1839, Perkins sold the mansion and donated the proceeds. This gift allowed the purchase of a more spacious building in [[South_Boston,_Boston,_Massachusetts|South Boston]]. In 1885, {{convert|6|acre|m2}} were purchased in the Hyde Square section of [[Jamaica_Plain,_Massachusetts|Jamaica Plain]], a residential district of Boston, to build a kindergarten. This property was home to both [[Laura_Bridgman|Laura Bridgman]] and [[Helen_Keller|Helen Keller]]. The school moved to its present campus, in [[Watertown,_Massachusetts|Watertown, Massachusetts]], in the autumn of 1912.

[[Charles_Dickens|Charles Dickens]] visited Perkins in 1842 during a lecture tour of America and was amazed at the work Howe was doing with Laura Bridgman, a deaf-blind girl who had come to the school in 1837 from New Hampshire. He wrote about his visit in his book, ''[[American_Notes|American Notes]]''.

In 1887, Perkins director Michael Anagnos sent graduate [[Anne_Sullivan|Anne Sullivan]] to teach Helen Keller in Alabama. After working with her pupil at the Keller home, Sullivan returned to Perkins with Keller in 1888 and resided there intermittently until 1893.

In 1931, [[Perkins_Braille_and_Talking_Book_Library|Perkins Braille and Talking Book Library]] (BTBL) was created.

In 1951, David Abraham successfully produced the first [[Perkins_Brailler|Perkins Brailler]]. By 1977, about 100,000 Perkins Braillers had been produced and distributed worldwide.
