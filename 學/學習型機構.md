'''學習型機構'''（Learning organization），或称 '''学习型组织'''，是指企业透过“[[组织学习|组织学习]]”实现员工知识更新和保持企业创新能力理论和实践。企业通过学习型组织试图使员工获得个人价值得以体现的满足，并使组织绩效得到提高。

最早涉及学习型组织的一些概念是由[[哈佛大学|哈佛大学]]的阿吉瑞斯（Chris Argyris）和舍恩（D.A.Schon）在1970年代提出的。1978年，两人合作发表了 专著《组织学习：一种行动透视理论》。 引发众多的世界级公司尝试在企业内部推广和建立学习型组织。1990年，[[麻省理工学院|麻省理工学院]]的[[彼得·聖吉|彼得·聖吉]]出版《第五项修練》，对这一理论进行了更全面的阐述和推广。 [[彼得·聖吉|彼得·聖吉]]提出了「五項修練」不斷的終身學習，以提升企業的競爭力：
*(1)第一項修練：自我超越(Personal Mastery)
*(2)第二項修練：改善心智模式(Improving Mental Models)
*(3)第三項修練：建立共同願景(Building Shared Vision)
*(4)第四項修練：團隊學習(Teaming Learning)
*(5)第五項修練：系統思考(Systems Thinking)

== 优点 ==
•维持企业高创新水平、保持企业竞争力

•提升对外界压力做出反应的能力

•将用户需求和资源完美結合

•提高产品品質

•引导更多人来建立共同形象

•加速组织内部的变革

== 障碍 ==
第一个障碍来自组织没有足够的时间。

比起改变企业的文化，员工和管理人员也许有其他优先考虑的问题，从而导致团队没有足够的时间和精力去建立一套体系。作为一个想要改变的组织，需要了解解决实际问题的必要步骤，团队里需要有一个精通这方面的指导者，来作为解决问题的人物。

其次，企业做出的改变并非同企业的需求有太大的关联。

企业的时间和精力需要分配在一些实际的、日常的问题上，为了解决这个问题，企业需要制定一个战略计划。

== Feedback ==

That is, organisations that are adapted for maximum [[organizational_learning|organizational learning]] and that build [[feedback_loop|feedback loop]]s deliberately to maximize their own learning.

Such a taxonomy almost always begins as a so-called "[[folksonomy|folksonomy]]", those [[keyword|keyword]]s that arise naturally from usage in the enterprise.

== Taxonomy ==

However, a learning organization must eventually establish a more solid description of what is subject to rapid change, and what is not.  This '''enterprise taxonomy''' is a common and agreed upon understanding of terms, concepts, categories and keywords that apply within that organization, and are expected to keep applying for many years as it grows and prospers.

It combines and specializes terms that are defined within technologies, industries and professions that have to be managed by core business or work processes of the enterprise or agency - ''often called by the Japanese term for this:  [[kaizen|kaizen]]''.  

The overall process resembles academic research in the social sciences.  However, as an enterprise has very narrow needs, it typically uses only a tiny subset of the terms and tests required for a full [[ontology|ontology]] - though an enterprise taxonomy can be considered to be either a very minimal [[foundation_ontology|foundation ontology]], or, a very large [[data_dictionary|data dictionary]].  Few enterprises have the resources to do more than combine and specialize the terms already defined by academics, so, typically, people with graduate degrees in social science become involved either as consultants or as the [[human_resources|human resources]] experts.

== Roles and flows ==

The most basic information is [[job_description|job description]]s, as [[ISO_9000|ISO 9000]] standards specify, and the organization's [[environmental_impact|environmental impact]] as the [[ISO_14000|ISO 14000]] standards specify.  ''Auditing of these two standards is now officially combined in the [[ISO_19011|ISO 19011]] protocol.''

Beyond that, the domains in which an enterprise must pay attention to change, versus those in which it must be constantly '''learning''', vary drastically with the type of enterprise, its customers and its marketing and supply relationships.  In any of these "departments":

Information must somehow be classified so that people can share and reuse organizational knowledge, increase efficiency, streamline business processes and facilitate integration with new technologies.  

== Challenging assumptions ==

Once it has established what they are, learning organization must constantly challenge its processes, instructions, assumptions and even its basic structure:
*the [[zero_base_budget|zero base budget]] technique whereby an organisation or division must redefine itself with each budget cycle, with no prior assumptions about how it is organised or what model of [[activity-based_costing|activity-based costing]] should apply.  Such a technique ensures that every manager can justify the [[total_cost_of_operations|total cost of operations]] of every aspect of their division or work.
*the [[back_to_the_floor|back to the floor]] method whereby an executive must regularly visit the shop floor as an ordinary worker.

Essentially, the true learning organization is redesigning itself constantly, using only its own '''taxonomy''' to decide what not to change.
