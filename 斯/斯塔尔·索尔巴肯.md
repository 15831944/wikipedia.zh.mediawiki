==生平==
===球員===
;早年
Solbakken, a midfielder, started his career in [[Norway|Norway]], playing for his local lower league team [[Grue_IL|Grue]]. After five seasons with Grue he moved to [[HamKam|HamKam]], a then-[[Adeccoligaen|second tier]] club, in 1989. 

He was the club's top goalscorer in the 1990 season, where he netted nine times. The following season he scored 14 goals to help the club to [[Promotion_and_relegation|promotion]] to the top-flight [[Tippeligaen|Norwegian Premier League]]. After narrowly avoiding relegation in his first season at the top level, Solbakken was part of the HamKam side that finished 5th in 1993 - a position they have not bettered since.

;利尼史特朗
In 1994 he transferred to their Premier League rivals [[Lillestrøm_SK|Lillestrøm]] where he finished as runner-up in the league during his first season. Although the club finished in fourth during the following campaign, Solbakken's performances saw him win the [[Kniksen_award#1995|Kniksen award]] as the Norwegian Midfielder of the Season.

He was appointed club captain by Lillestrøm and helped the side again finish runners-up in 1996 before he serving one final season in 1997 for ''the Canaries''. In total, he made 99 league appearances for the club, scoring 34 times. 

;出國
In October 1997, Solbakken joined [[Premier_League|English Premier League]] club [[Wimbledon_F.C.|Wimbledon]] for £250,000.<ref>{{cite news |title=Football: Wimbledon sign Norwegian |first=Alan |last=Nixon |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-wimbledon-sign-norwegian-1235892.html |work=The Independent |publisher=Independent Print Limited |date=14 October 1997 |accessdate=11 May 2012}}</ref> In his six league games for Wimbledon, Solbakken scored one goal against [[West_Ham_United_F.C.|West Ham United]],<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-wimbledon-hand-the-hammers-a-gift-of-three-points-1290965.html|title=Wimbledon hand the Hammers a gift of three points |publisher=[[The_Independent|The Independent]] |date=28 December 1997 | location=London| first=Mike| last=Rowbottom}}</ref> and was twice named "[[man_of_the_match|man of the match]]", but he fell out with team manager [[Joe_Kinnear|Joe Kinnear]] and was banned from club training shortly thereafter.<ref>{{da icon}} John Laden Jensen, [http://www.aabsport.dk/96CF7553-3EFB-42E0-9F3E-B9DE67F765D4.W5Doc?id=2143be3a-3b21-437c-b311-dc11b397295a Solbakken, Ståle], AaBsport.dk</ref>

He was quickly sold to [[Denmark|Danish]] side [[AaB_Fodbold|Aalborg BK]] in March 1998. Solbakken became Aalborg BK's captain, and guided the club to the [[1998–99_Danish_Superliga|1998–99 Danish Superliga]] championship, as well as the final of the [[1998–99_Danish_Cup|1998–99]] [[Danish_Cup|Danish Cup]] tournament. He won Danish football's Player of the Year Award in 2000. In total, he played 79 games and scored 13 goals for AaB in the Danish Superliga.<ref>[http://www.danskfodbold.com/spiller.php?ligaid=2001&spillerid=10457 Ståle Solbakken] at DanskFodbold.com</ref> 

In August 2000, he departed to to Danish league rivals [[F.C._Copenhagen|Copenhagen]]. Solbakken quickly became a regular player in the side and helped push them to the top of the table but he was unable to complete the season after suffering a [[myocardial_infarction|heart attack]] in March 2001. The club went on to win the [[2000–01_Danish_Superliga|2001 Superliga]] championship and give Solbakken a second championship medal as a player.

;心臟病發
During training on 13 March 2001 Solbakken had a [[myocardial_infarction|heart attack]]. He was rapidly attended to by the club doctor Frank Odgaard who found that his heart had stopped beating. He asked a player to call an ambulance and to tell them it was critical, whilst he continued to administer cardiac massage. Upon the ambulance's arrival, Solbakken was pronounced [[clinically_dead|clinically dead]] at the scene.<ref name="guardian">Marcus Christenson, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2006/nov/01/newsstory.championsleague1 Why football is not a matter of life and death for Solbakken], [[The_Guardian|The Guardian]], 1 November 2006.</ref> On the way to the hospital in the ambulance he was revived nearly seven minutes later. 

He survived the episode and now has a [[Artificial_pacemaker|pacemaker]] fitted. The heart attack was the result of a previously undetected heart defect.<ref name="guardian"/> Shortly after, on medical advice, he announced his playing retirement.

;國家隊
Solbakken made his international debut for the [[Norway_national_football_team|Norwegian national team]] on 9 March 1994, in a 3–1 friendly win in [[Wales_national_football_team|Wales]]. Although he was not named in the squad for the [[1994_FIFA_World_Cup|1994 World Cup]], he became a regular feature in the squad soon after. 

He was a member of the Norwegian team that qualified for [[1998_FIFA_World_Cup|1998 World Cup]], where he appeared in two of their group games (against [[Morocco_national_football_team|Morocco]] and [[Scotland_national_football_team|Scotland]]) as well as their second round exit to [[Italy_national_football_team|Italy]].

His country qualified for the next major tournament, [[UEFA_Euro_2000|the 2000 European Championship]], but Solbakken picked up an injury shortly before the finals. In the end, he was only able to appear in one tournament game: a goalless draw with [[Slovenia_national_football_team|Slovenia]] that eliminated them in the group stage. After this exit, he announced his international retirement, aged 32.

In total, he won 58 caps for Norway, scoring nine times.

===教練===
;咸卡
In 2002, Solbakken returned to Norway and started his managerial career at his old club HamKam, positioned at the second tier. He had great success at HamKam, as the club won the league and was promoted to the top-flight Tippeligaen. His "resurrection", and the "salvation" (i.e. promotion) of HamKam, earned him the nickname "Ståle Salvatore", often cited in Norwegian press since.<ref>http://www.vg.no/sport/fotball/ligaer/tyskland/artikkel.php?artid=10057368</ref>
<br />
The next season, Solbakken managed HamKam to a fifth place in the [[Tippeligaen_2004|Tippeligaen 2004]] season, and he won the [[Kniksen_award#2004|2004 Kniksen award]] as Norwegian Manager of the Year. In late 2005, Solbakken was named as new manager of another of his former clubs, [[F.C._Copenhagen|Copenhagen]].

;哥本哈根
In his first years at the club, Solbakken guided Copenhagen to the [[2005–06_Danish_Superliga|2006]] and [[2006–07_Danish_Superliga|2007]] [[Danish_Superliga|Danish Superliga]] championship, as well as the [[Royal_League_2005–06|2006]] [[Royal_League|Royal League]] trophy. He managed Copenhagen through to the group stage of the [[2006–07_UEFA_Champions_League|2006–07 UEFA Champions League]], after beating [[AFC_Ajax|Ajax]] in the final qualifying round on 23 August 2006. Copenhagen finished last in its group, though they won a meriting 1–0 victory against later semi-finalists [[Manchester_United_F.C.|Manchester United]].

On 16 February 2009, in an interview prior to Copenhagen's [[UEFA_Europa_League|Cup]] tie against [[Manchester_City_F.C.|Manchester City]], Solbakken claimed that Manchester City were ''"destroying football"'' with their ''"incredible sums"'' of money, referring to Manchester City's bid of over ''£100million'' to sign [[Kaká|Kaká]].<ref>[http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=619894&sec=europe&cc=5901 City are killing football, blasts Solbakken], [[Soccernet|Soccernet]], 17 February 2009.</ref> Copenhagen were eventually eliminated by Manchester City on a 3–4 [[Playoff_format#Total_points_series_(aggregate)|aggregate score]].

In May 2009, Solbakken led Copenhagen [[Double_(association_football)|the Double]] of both the [[2008–09_Danish_Cup|2009 Danish Cup]] and the [[2008–09_Danish_Superliga|2009 Superliga]] championship, the seventh championship in club history. On 3 November 2009, it was announced that Solbakken would not renew his Copenhagen contract which ended on 30 June 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://fck.dk/index.php?pageid=754&newsid=9768 |title=Ståle Solbakken bliver norsk landstræner i 2012 |date=3 November 2009 |accessdate=3 November 2009 |language=Danish |publisher=[[F.C._Copenhagen|F.C. Copenhagen]]}}</ref> Instead, he agreed a [[letter_of_intent|letter of intent]] to become Norwegian national team manager either in January 2012 or after the [[UEFA_Euro_2012|Euro 2012]], should Norway qualify.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fotball.no/Landslag_og_toppfotball/Landslag/A-menn/2009/Olsen-fortsetter-og-etterfolges-av-Solbakken/ |title=Olsen fortsetter og etterfølges av Solbakken |date=3 November 2009 |accessdate=3 November 2009 |language=Norwegian |publisher=[[Football_Association_of_Norway|Football Association of Norway]]}}</ref> However, this agreement was ultimately not to come to fruition.

;科隆
On 14 May 2011 it was announced that Solbakken would take over as manager of [[1._FC_Köln|1. FC Köln]] of the German [[Fußball-Bundesliga|Bundesliga]] from [[Director_of_football|sporting director]] [[Volker_Finke|Volker Finke]], who acted as interim manager after [[Frank_Schaefer|Frank Schaefer]] quit during the season.<ref name="Köln">{{cite web |url=http://www.goal.com/en-us/news/1956/europe/2011/05/14/2486732/koln-confirm-stale-solbakken-as-new-coach-for-next-season/ |title=Köln confirm Stale Solbakken as new manager for next season |date=14 May 2011 |publisher=[[goal.com|goal.com]]}}</ref> Solbakken had been due to take the Norwegian national team job in January 2012 but Köln bought out his contract for a reported €400,000.<ref name="Köln"></ref>

He won his first game in charge, a [[DFB-Pokal|DFB Cup]] tie at [[SC_Wiedenbrück_2000|SC Wiedenbrück]], but took four league games to register his first victory. By the winter break Köln sat in 10th place, but their form plummeted in the second half of the campaign and they dropped into a relegation battle. This decline in form was coupled with several negative incidents involving their squad misbehaving off the field.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/football-league/solbakken-arrives-at-wolves--well-schooled-in-dealing-with-turmoil-7737892.html |title=Solbakken arrives at Wolves – well schooled in dealing with turmoil |date=12 May 2012 |publisher=[[The_Independent|The Independent]]}}</ref> Solbakken later quipped that "[[Jesus|Jesus]] and [[José_Mourinho|José Mourinho]] would have struggled together at that club this year".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2144144/Stale-Solbakken-plays-talk-Wolves-promotion.html?ITO=1490 |title=New Wolves boss Solbakken refuses to predict instant Premier League return |date=14 May 2012|publisher=[[Daily_Mail|Daily Mail]]}}</ref>

Solbakken was put on "a leave of absence" by Köln on 12 April 2012 following a 0–4 loss at [[1._FSV_Mainz_05|Mainz]], with the team sat in 16th place.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/15/germany/2012/04/12/3031997/official-koln-put-solbakken-on-leave-and-appoint-schaefer-as |title=Official: Koln put Solbakken on leave and appoint Schaefer as coach |date=12 April 2012 |publisher=[[goal.com|goal.com]]}}</ref> He was replaced by former coach [[Frank_Schaefer|Frank Schaefer]] who oversaw the final four games of the season during which the club dropped to 17th place and so were relegated.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/match/61143/1-fc-köln-vs-fc-bayern-münchen/report |title=1.

;狼隊
On 11 May 2012, English club [[Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] announced that Solbakken was to become their new manager. He will officially take over from acting manager [[Terry_Connor|Terry Connor]] on 1 July 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18030227 |title=Wolves appoint Norwegian Stale Solbakken as new manager |date=11 May 2012 |publisher=[[BBC_Sport|BBC Sport]]}}</ref> Solbakken will start the season with Wolves in the [[Football_League_Championship|Football League Championship]] as the side were relegated from the [[Premier_League|English Premier League]] at the end of the 2011–12 season.
