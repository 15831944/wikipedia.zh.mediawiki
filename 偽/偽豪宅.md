'''偽豪宅'''相對於真正的[[豪宅|豪宅]]是以廉價建材和手工大量建造再以高價銷售的住宅，其內外的裝橫都被設計師和媒體批評為庸俗浮誇，甚至違反實用和審美將不搭調的建築元素東拼西湊<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mcmansionhell.com/post/156315134881/mcmansion-hell-around-the-world-where-and-why-do|date=2017-01-24|website=McMansion Hell|publisher=Tumblr|accessdate=2017-07-01|title=McMansion Hell Around the World: Where and Why Do We Build McMansions}}</ref>。在[[美國|美國]]，用來標籤偽豪宅的時髦名詞「McMansion」（'''麥豪宅'''）始見於1980年代媒體以形容市郊住宅區那些佔地龐大的低俗大宅<ref>An example from ''Braces, gym suits, and early-morning seminary: a youthquake survival manual'' (1985) by Joni Winn [Hilton]: "The McMansion, by the way, is really just the largest house in the neighborhood"</ref>，其後迅速被主流媒體借用如[[洛杉磯時報|洛杉磯時報]]<ref>Book Review: Search for Environmental View of Design, Review of 'Out of Place: Restoring Identity to the Regional Landscape', by Michael Hough Yale University Press. Los Angeles Times, July 17, 1990. "What character their history and ecology might offer is being strip-mined to make way for anonymous residential projects, monolithic office towers, climate-controlled retail complexes of questionable design and awkward transportation systems—all in the abused name of progress. We are talking here of the march of mini-malls and 'McMansions.{{' "}}</ref><ref>Interiors; Getting Smart About Art of Living Small. Los Angeles Times, September 19, 1998. "The size of the average new single-family home has gone from {{convert|1520|sqft|m2}} in 1971 to {{convert|2120|sqft|m2}} in 1996, according to '1998 Housing Facts, Figures and Trends,' published by the National Assn. of Home Builders. 'But not everyone is living in a McMansion or aspires to it," said Gale Steves, editor of ''Home Magazine''". "Every time we do a small house in the magazine, there is lots of mail."</ref>和[[紐約時報|紐約時報]]<ref>Cheever, Benjamin - Close to home; Life in a Crater Will Do, For Now. ''New York Times'', August 27, 1998. "Twenty mansions were planned for the development, each designed to look like the biggest house in town. The McMansion we thought of as ours had an enormous kitchen, more than two stories high."</ref>。這個新詞相信是結合了連鎖快餐廳[[麥當勞|麥當勞]]各餐的開頭「Mc（麥）」和「Mansion（宅邸）」以諷刺這些住宅的質素如同[[快餐|快餐]]般低廉<ref>{{cite book|last=McFedries|first=Paul|title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to Weird Word Origins|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zwxmGXmOZqwC&pg=PA99|year=2008|publisher=Alpha Books|isbn=978-1-59257-781-1|page=99}}</ref>。在[[香港|香港]]，偽豪宅亦指那些為了鑽建築條例漏洞卻違反實用原則設計、或實用面積極為細小卻包裝成豪宅推銷的住宅，這類[[圖則|圖則]]（平面圖）被香港媒體戲稱為「奇則」，取廣東話「奇蹟」的諧音。
