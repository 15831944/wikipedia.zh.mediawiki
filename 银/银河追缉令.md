<!-- 檔案不存在 [[File:GalaxyQuestCast.JPG|thumb]], [[Alan_Rickman|Alan Rickman]], [[Tim_Allen|Tim Allen]], [[Daryl_Mitchell|Daryl Mitchell]], [[Sigourney_Weaver|Sigourney Weaver]], [[Tony_Shalhoub|Tony Shalhoub]]]] -->

* [[Tim_Allen|Tim Allen]] as Jason Nesmith<!-- , the actor who played Cmdr. Peter Quincy Taggart, the captain of the ''Protector'', during the original television run. Jason remains the putative leader of the ''Galaxy Quest'' crew members as they travel to conventions and [[strip_mall|strip mall]] dedications. He's prone to removing his shirt at the slightest pretext and is said to have had romantic relations with most of the minor female characters who appeared throughout his television career. -->
* [[Sigourney_Weaver|Sigourney Weaver]] as Gwen DeMarco<!-- , the actress who played Lt. Tawny Madison, the Computer Officer of the ''Protector'', who performed communication duties. As the show's female sex symbol, Tawny's job consists largely of repeating communications to and from the computer. Weaver later compared her meta-fictional role as Tawny to her role as [[Ellen_Ripley|Ellen Ripley]] in the ''[[Alien_(film)|Alien]]'' series, describing Tawny as "a stereotypical dumb blonde" who fulfills a useless function in contrast to Ripley's dynamic centrality.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} It's implied (and believed by enthusiastic female fans at the convention) that Gwen and Jason are romantically interested in each other, though they won't bring themselves to admit this until the film's end. -->
* [[Alan_Rickman|Alan Rickman]] as Sir Alexander Dane<!-- , the actor who played Dr. Lazarus of Tev'Meck. Lazarus is a "Mak'tar", a member of an alien [[species|species]] renowned for their intellect. He is deeply intelligent and has [[psionics|psionic]] abilities. Additionally, he has a non-standard weapon and a pretentious [[catchphrase|catchphrase]]: "By Grabthar's hammer, by the suns of Warvan, you ''shall'' be avenged!". A trained Shakespearean British actor, Alexander resents both his catchphrase and being [[Typecasting_(acting)|typecast]]. He's the last of the actors to embrace his television role (in order to satisfy the Thermians) and only does so when Quellek (a Thermian who idolizes Dr. Lazarus) dies in his arms. -->
* [[托尼·夏爾赫布|托尼·夏爾赫布]] as Fred Kwan<!-- , the actor who played Tech Sgt. Chen. Chen is in charge of the engine room and the operator of the "digital conveyor" (a version of the ''Star Trek'' [[Transporter_(Star_Trek)|transporter]]). He acts in a detached manner and is completely unfazed by the strange and usually disturbing events that occur. He is the only actor to not be terrified by the experience of transporting through space, merely commenting "That was a hell of a thing." Unlike the other actors, he thoroughly enjoys the entire experience and is completely comfortable with the true form of the aliens; he even falls in love with Laliari. -->
* [[Sam_Rockwell|Sam Rockwell]] as Guy Fleegman<!-- , the actor who played "Crewman #6" in the original series and Security Chief "Roc" Ingersoll in the revival. Guy begins the story as a "Questerian" ([[Trekkie|Trekkie]]) who had a small role as a disposable [[Redshirt_(character)|redshirt]] in many episodes of the series and was an emcee at the 18th annual Galaxy Quest Convention, greeting the actors familiarly although they don't recognize him. He spends most of the movie fretting about his imminent demise, which he believes is inevitable for minor characters such as his, showing a difficulty to separate reality from fiction when in (perceived) danger. Ironically, he suffers the fewest injuries of any of the actors during the flight on the ''Protector''. At times his fears based on fiction cliché turn out to be reasonable, as when he prevents Gwen from approaching apparently harmless child-like aliens, who are subsequently revealed to be hostile and cannibalistic. In reaction to this, he exclaims "Didn't you guys ever ''watch'' the show? -->
* [[Daryl_Mitchell|Daryl Mitchell]] as Tommy Webber / Lt. Laredo<!-- , a parody of "boy wonder"-type characters, who has aged considerably since his role. His role as Laredo is essentially that of a pilot, but when he flies the real ''Protector'' out of the spaceport, he scrapes it against a wall and it takes him most of the film (and re-watching old ''Galaxy Quest'' episodes) to learn to do it properly. [[Corbin_Bleu|Corbin Bleu]] played Tommy at age 9 during the film's introduction, a "recording" of an original episode. -->
* [[Enrico_Colantoni|Enrico Colantoni]] as Mathesar<!-- , the leader of the Thermians. Mathesar is, like all of his people, an upright octopoid who appears as a white-skinned, gray-clad, black-haired human, speaks in stiff tones of voice, smiles warmly even when in sorrow or fear. As Sarris explains to Jason, Mathesar is incredibly naïve to the truth, as are the others of his crew; however, he remains very loyal to Nesmith and the other actors, still seeing them as heroes. In the end, he develops his own courage, knocks out Sarris, and is proud of being a hero himself. He's also very understanding and empathic, as he lets Laliari stay with Fred on Earth. -->

<!-- ===“星际迷航”演员的反应===
* I had originally not wanted to see ''Galaxy Quest'' because I heard that it was making fun of ''Star Trek'', and then [[Jonathan_Frakes|Jonathan Frakes]] rang me up and said "You must not miss this movie! See it on a Saturday night in a full theatre." And I did, and of course I found it was brilliant. Brilliant. No one laughed louder or longer in the cinema than I did, but the idea that the ship was saved and all of our heroes in that movie were saved simply by the fact that there were fans who did understand the scientific principles on which the ship worked was absolutely wonderful. And it was both funny and also touching in that it paid tribute to the dedication of these fans. — [[Patrick_Stewart|Patrick Stewart]]<ref name="PSI"/><ref>{{cite news|last=Lyall |first=Sarah |title=To Boldly Go Where Shakespeare Calls |work=New York Times |date=January 27, 2008 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/27/theater/27lyal.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all&oref=slogin |accessdate=June 28, 2008}}</ref>
* I thought it was very funny, and I thought the audience that they portrayed was totally real, but the actors that they were pretending to be were totally unrecognizable. Certainly I don't know what Tim Allen was doing. He seemed to be the head of a group of actors, and for the life of me I was trying to understand who he was imitating. The only one I recognized was the girl playing [[Nichelle_Nichols|Nichelle Nichols]]. — [[William_Shatner|William Shatner]] (jokingly sending himself up, as he is the one Allen was parodying), who played [[James_T._Kirk|James T. Kirk]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}
* I've had flashbacks of ''Galaxy Quest'' at the many conventions I've gone to since the movie came out. I thought it was an absolute laugh-a-minute. — [[Tim_Russ|Tim Russ]], who played the [[Vulcan_(Star_Trek)|Vulcan]] [[Tuvok|Lt. Cmdr. Tuvok]] on ''[[Star_Trek:_Voyager|Star Trek: Voyager]]''{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}
* Yes, I have seen ''Galaxy Quest'' and no, ''Star Trek'' fandom is not really like that. — [[Casey_Biggs|Casey Biggs]], who played the [[Cardassian|Cardassian]] Legate [[Damar_(Star_Trek)|Damar]] on ''[[Star_Trek:_Deep_Space_Nine|Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]''{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}
* I loved ''Galaxy Quest''. I thought it was brilliant satire, not only of ''Trek'', but of fandom in general. The only thing I wish they had done was cast me in it, and have me play a freaky fanboy who keeps screaming at the actor who played "the kid" about how awful it was that there was a kid on the spaceship. Alas. — [[Wil_Wheaton|Wil Wheaton]], who played "the kid" [[Wesley_Crusher|Wesley Crusher]] in ''[[Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation|Star Trek: The Next Generation]]''<ref>[http://www.wilwheaton.net/mt/archives/000768.php Where is my mind? - Tangent] WIL WHEATON dot NET, September 24, 2001</ref>
* I think it's a chillingly realistic documentary. ''[laughs]'' The details in it, I recognized every one of them. It is a powerful piece of documentary filmmaking. And I do believe that when we get kidnapped by aliens, it's going to be the genuine, true ''Star Trek'' fans who will save the day. ... I was rolling in the aisles. And [star] Tim Allen had that Shatner-esque swagger down pat. And I roared when the shirt came off, and [co-star] Sigourney [Weaver] rolls her eyes and says, 'There goes that shirt again.' ... How often did we hear that on the set?

==与“星际迷航”的联系==

''Galaxy Quest''被公认为是对星际迷航的纪念，因此它们之间有很多相似点。电视剧版的将主体设置在飞船“保卫者”上，很明显是模仿[[聯邦星艦企業號|聯邦星艦企業號]]以及[[星际舰队|星际舰队]]。飞船保卫者的型号NTE-3120 表面上暗示跟某个联邦行星有关，但其实代表着“Not The Enterprise”（不是企业号）。该消息的来源是视觉特效主管Bill George在2000年时接受''Cinefex''杂志的采访记录<ref>Jody Duncan & Estelle Shay, "Trekking into the Klaatu Nebula", ''Cinefex'' 81, April 2000</ref>。
这种纪念甚至影响到了该片的营销，包括其官方网站的风格<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20011202071547/http://www.galaxyquest.com/galaxyquest/index.html Welcome to Travis Latke's Galaxy Quest Vaults]</ref>，有意让它看起来界面粗糙。

* In December 1999，一个美国娱乐频道制作了一期特别节目：''Galaxy Quest: 20th Anniversary, The Journey Continues''
* In 2003, 丹麦摇滚乐队 [[Blindstone|Blindstone]]制作了一首歌"By Grabthar's Hammer"于专辑''Manifesto''.
* In 2008, [[IDW_Publishing|IDW Publishing]] 发行了该片的一系列后续漫画。
