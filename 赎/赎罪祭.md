'''赎罪祭'''（{{lang-he|קרבן חטאת}}; {{lang-en|'''hattath'''}}；{{lang-en|'''sin offering'''}}）是古代[[犹太教|犹太教]]的一种祭典，根据[[利未记|利未记]]规定，以色列人无意中犯罪<ref>《[[犹太百科全书|犹太百科全书]]》</ref>，需要献上规定的祭物。在[[基督教|基督教]]中，赎罪经常指耶稣的受难与受死。

==类型与时机==
大体上，用作赎罪祭的献祭动物取决于献祭者：为[[大祭司_(犹太教)|大祭司]]或以色列全会众献祭，必须要献上公牛；为国王或王子献祭，必须要献上公[[山羊|山羊]]；为平民献祭，必须要献上母山羊或绵羊羔；对于无力承受的穷人，可以献上两只斑鸠或雏鸽<ref>ibid</ref>。与其他类型的祭物一样，所献的祭物都必须是完全没有残疾的。

除了对于上述无意中犯的罪以外，以下也需要献上赎罪祭：
*在[[赎罪日|赎罪日]] - [[大祭司|大祭司]]要献上公牛，会众要献上公[[山羊|山羊]]。
*在祭司就职时，祭司要献上小牛，会众要献上小山羊。
*在[[拿细耳人|拿细耳人]]遵守特别誓约期满时，要献上一只没有残疾、一岁的母羊羔作赎罪祭。
*在麻风病人洁净之后，要献上母羊作赎罪祭。
*妇女[[分娩|分娩]]之后，要献上斑鸠。<!--
*after [[Niddah|Niddah]] (temporary marital separation due to [[月经|月经]]) or recovery from [[zivah|zivah]] (abnormal bodily discharges) - the offering in both cases being a dove or young pidgeon -->

'''赎罪祭的预表意义'''

赎罪祭表征基督替我们成为罪，在十字架上藉着死定罪了罪。主要就着人类原罪本质和基督救赎的工作，提醒人内在的罪性。

<!-- ==Sacrificial ritual==
The ritual of 赎罪祭 began with the offerer(s) confessing their sins over the head of the victim; in the case of community offerings the elders performed this function; in the case of Yom Kippur, the high priest performs this task. The animal would then be killed by the offerer, or the priest if the offerer preferred, and the blood carefully collected by [[Levites|Levites]] in an earthen vessel. In the case of sacrifices at [[Temple_in_Jerusalem|Temple in Jerusalem]]<ref>''Jewish Encyclopedia''</ref>, some of the blood would be sprinkled in front of the veil covering the entrance to[[至圣所|至圣所]], except on Yom Kippur, when the blood would be sprinkled in front of the [[mercy_seat|mercy seat]]; this was done seven times. The remainder of the blood was poured out at the base of the altar, and the earthen vessel that had contained it would be smashed, while the [[fat|fat]], [[liver|liver]], [[kidney|kidney]]s, and [[caul|caul]], were burnt on the altar. 

The flesh was later consumed by the priest and his family, except when 祭司本人 was among the offerers (such as in community offerings, and in the case of Yom Kippur), when it would be burnt outside the sanctuary.根据[[textual_criticism|textual scholars]] these rules originate from two different layers in [[priestly_source|priestly source]], thought by scholars to be one of the source texts of the torah; the [[Priestly_code|Priestly code]] within the priestly source is believed to be a series of additions to the text, from Aaronid editors, over a large period of time<ref>''Jewish Encyclopedia'', ''Priestly Code''</ref>. The earlier source is thought to be the one referring to the flesh being consumed by the priests<ref>the latter part of Leviticus 6 falls into this source</ref>, while the later source<ref>which Leviticus 4 falls within</ref> reflects a development where the flesh from sin offerings was seen as insufficiently holy and thus needing to be disposed elsewhere<ref>''Jewish Encyclopedia'', ''sin offering''</ref>. In [[Book_of_Hosea|Book of Hosea]], a reference to the earlier form<ref>Hosea 4:7-8</ref> suggests a possible reason for the change - the priests were accused of rejoycing in the people's wickedness as they were living off the ''sin offerings''<ref>''Jewish Encyclopedia'', et passim</ref>. 

When the sacrificial animal was a bird, however, the ritual was quite different. The bird was slaughtered by a thumb being pushed into its neck, and the head being wrung off. A second bird would then be burnt on the altar as a ''[[whole_sacrifice|whole sacrifice]]'', completely immolated by fire<ref>ibid</ref>. --> 

<!-- ==起源==
尽管被称为“赎罪祭”，it is more likely that such offerings began as offerings made for unintentionally breaking a [[taboo|taboo]] (here meaning something which is seen as sacred but simultaneously prohibited). The offerings for recovery from discharges and childbirth being for the breaking of a taboo about contact with blood - pus potentially containing blood, menstruation obviously containing it, and in the case of childbirth blood comes with the [[placenta|placenta]]. Textual scholars believe that the biblical regulation specifying the offering for childbirth<ref>in Leviticus 12</ref> originally fell among those concerning bodily discharges<ref>in Leviticus 15</ref>(due to various textual features), and hence that childbirth was treated as a form of abnormal ''discharge'', for which a period of recovery was required<ref>''Jewish Encyclopedia'', ''Priestly Code''</ref>. 

The Nazarite's offering being due to the breaking of the Nazarite's own taboo nature, due to consecration to the deity, when the Nazarite vow was terminated<ref>''Jewish Encyclopedia'', ''sin offering''</ref>. Tzaraas was seen as a disease inflicted by God, as punishment for transgression of [[mitzvah|mitzvot]]<ref>''Jewish Encyclopedia'', ''leprosy''</ref>, and hence people becoming inflicted with Tzaraas themselves being seen as taboo (thus being temporarily expelled from society as a result); the ''sin offering'' for recovery from tzaaras, for which the same sacrificial animal as the Nazarite's ''sin offering'' is proscribed, being due to the breaking of this taboo state by the act of recovering<ref>''Jewish Encyclopedia'', ''sin offering''</ref>. -->

<!-- The Yom Kippur sin offering is considered to have developed slightly later; the biblical text seems to explain this offering as being for the purpose of protecting the high priest from death (''...so that he does not die'') when he approached the [[mercy_seat|mercy seat]]<ref>ibid</ref>, an action which was taboo (as the mercy seat was seen as sacred, but approach to it was prohibited). The passage in which this is explained as being about atonement for real sin<ref>Leviticus 16:16</ref>, rather than just breach of this taboo, being considered by textual scholars to be a later gloss added to the text<ref>''Jewish Encyclopedia''</ref>。“赎罪祭”required when a priest had sinned, for which there is a similar sacrificial animal as the Yom Kippur offering, is considered by scholars to be a much later development, and only added to the text of Leviticus in the latest stages of its compilation, after ''sin offerings'' had begun to be seen as being about atonement for actual sin rather than relatively immediate breaches of taboos<ref>ibid</ref>.

The other 赎罪祭are considered by scholars to be represent gradual developments; from being offered 在接触了不洁净的动物之后，which is more of a taboo, to being offered for ritual uncleanliness in general, and finally to being offered for arbitrary sins<ref>ibid</ref>. The gradations, according to which the type of sacrificial animal depends on the social status of the sinner, are considered by textual scholars to also be a later development, from a similar period of time as these offerings for actual sin<ref>''Jewish Encyclopedia'', ''Leviticus''</ref> -->
