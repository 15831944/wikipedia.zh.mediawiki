[[File:Hood,_13th_century.png|thumb]]
几个世纪以来，连帽衫一直被认为是男装和女装的一部分。“连帽衫”这个名字来自于盎格鲁-撒克逊语的''hōd''一词<ref name="Cyclopaedia">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jGMYAQAAMAAJ&dq=A%20Cyclopaedia%20of%20Costume%20Or%20Dictionary%20of%20Dress%2C%20Including%20Notices%20of%20Contemporaneous%20Fashions%20on%20the%20Continent&lr&hl=de&pg=PA291#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=A Cyclopaedia of Costume Or Dictionary of Dress, Including Notices of Contemporaneous Fashions on the Continent|first=James Robinson|last=Planché|volume=1|place=London|publisher=Chatto and Windus|year=1876|page=291}}</ref> （和英语中的"hat"（帽子）同源<ref>Article [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=hood&allowed_in_frame=0 "hood"], in ''Online Etymology Dictionary''.</ref> ）。这种服装的风格和形式的历史可以追溯到中世纪的欧洲。当时的僧侣平常的服装包括一种附在外衣或长袍上的一种叫hood的大兜帽<ref name="yusuf">{{Cite news|url=http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/fashion/article1084338.ece |title=The hoody grows up |accessdate=2007-06-28 |author=Yusuf, Nilgin |date=2006-08-12 |work=Times Online | location=London}}</ref>，除此之外，连帽披风和一种叫{{tsl|en|Chaperon (headgear)|Chaperon}}的帽子也是在当时的户外工作者中非常普遍的装扮。连帽衫最早至少在十二世纪的英国出现，这可能是在[[诺曼征服英格兰|诺曼征服英格兰]]时进口的。<ref name="Cyclopaedia" />

连帽衫在20世纪30年代在美国第一次开始批量生产。现代的连帽衫最早在20世纪30年代由{{tsl|en|Champion (sportswear)|Champion}}生产，当时连帽衫主要销售给在纽约北部严寒地区工作的工人。<ref name="nyt">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/23/opinion/23wilson.html |title=A Look Under the Hoodie |accessdate=2007-06-28 |author=Wilson, Denis |date=2006-12-23 |work=The New York Times }}</ref>“连帽衫”这个词在20世纪90年代于大众中流行。<ref>"hoodie | hoody, n.".

Hooded garments have been a documented part of men's and women's wear for centuries.

Its appearance was known in England at least as early as the 12th century, possibly an import with the [[Norman_conquest_of_England|Norman conquest of England]], as the ''capa'' was "a short hooded cloak which was common in Normandy".<ref name="Cyclopaedia"/> The hooded sweatshirt was first produced in the [[United_States|United States]] starting in the 1930s.

The hoodie took off in the [[1970s_in_fashion|1970s]], with several factors contributing to its success. [[Hip_hop_culture|Hip hop culture]] developed in [[New_York_City|New York City]] around this time, and high fashion also contributed during this era, as Norma Kamali and other high-profile designers embraced and glamorized the new clothing.<ref name="yusuf" /> Most critical to the hoodie's popularity during this time was its iconic appearance in the blockbuster ''[[Rocky|Rocky]]'' film.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} At the same time hoodies started emerging in the Geek culture when Mark LoGiurato, introduced them at companies such as the Software Bottling Company.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://lordofthenerds.wix.com/lordofthenerds/apps/blog/pop-culture-vs-geek-culture  |title=POP CULTURE VS.

Across Canada, hoodies are a popular clothing item in which are sometimes worn under a coat or jacket to provide an extra layer of clothing during the winter. In the province of [[Saskatchewan|Saskatchewan]], hoodies without zippers are "bunny hugs."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/saskatchewan-slang-video-a-big-hit-1.2983009|title=Saskatchewan slang video a big hit|publisher=[[Canadian_Broadcasting_Corporation|Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=May 5, 2015|accessdate=February 15, 2016}}</ref>

The "Hoodies on Parliament—politicians challenge youth stereotypes" campaign was launched in May 2008 in [[New_Zealand|New Zealand]] (NZ) as part of the annual national Youth Week event, a pro-youth initiative organized to challenge youth stereotypes. To launch the campaign, NZ politicians, including National MP Nicky Wagner, Green Party MPs Sue Bradford, Nandor Tanczos and Metiria Turei, and Maori party MP Hone Harawira, wore hoodies while standing on the steps of the country's parliament. Archbishop David Moxon, Archbishop of the Anglican Dioceses, and Brian Turner President of the Methodist Church of NZ also participated in the campaign.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hoodies on Parliament challenging youth stereotype|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/CU0805/S00305.htm|accessdate=7 December 2014|work=Scoop|date=29 May 2008}}</ref>

Support and criticism were raised by politicians, who were divided over the 2008 event.<ref>{{cite web|title=Politicians support Hoodie Day|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/content/1806287/2591754.xhtml|website=TVNZ|publisher=TVNZ.co.nz|accessdate=7 December 2014|date=30 May 2008}}</ref><ref name="NZ_Herald_10512586">{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10512586 |title=Youth Week Hoodie Day criticised |author=Tait, Maggie |date=26 May 2008 |agency=[[NZPA|NZPA]] |newspaper=[[The_New_Zealand_Herald|The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=3 October 2011}}</ref> One strong response was drawn from a local government council member, Dale Evans, who donned a [[Ku_Klux_Klan|Ku Klux Klan]] outfit in protest, citing the hoodie as "not an appropriate article of clothing to celebrate."<ref name="NZ_Herald_10513425">{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10513425 |title=Councillor stuns board with Ku Klux Klan outfit |date=30 May 2008 |work=[[The_New_Zealand_Herald|The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=3 October 2011}}</ref>

"Goodie in a Hoodie" day was then run in 2009 by New Zealand Adolescent Health and Development (NZAAHD) in partnership with Age Concern—the organisations used the campaign to highlight the stereotypes that both young people and the elderly face in New Zealand. Liz Baxendine, president of Age Concern at the time, said to the media:

<blockquote>
Older people and young people have a lot in common. We both face stereotypes based on our age rather than our real achievements and outlook on life ... we've got to destigmatise the hoodie and see it for what it is. Everyone wears them. We need to take the hoodie back!<ref>{{cite news|author1=Kathryn King|title=Oldies but hoodies|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/wanganui-chronicle/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503426&objectid=10985317|accessdate=7 December 2014|work=Wanganui Chronicle|date=12 August 2009}}</ref></blockquote>

In the [[United_Kingdom|UK]], hoodies have been the subject of much criticism; some shoplifters have used the hood to conceal their identities from [[Closed-circuit_television|CCTV]] cameras in shopping centres.<ref>{{Cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,3604,1482816,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=In the hood | first=Gareth | last=McLean | date=2005-05-13 | accessdate=2010-05-04}}</ref> The hoodie became a popular clothing item by the 1990s. During the 21st century, it had gained a negative image, being associated with trouble making teens and [[Anti-social_behavior|anti-social behaviour]]. It became one of the later items associated with "[[chav|chav]]s", or [[Neds|Neds]].

Angela McRobbie, professor of communications at [[Goldsmiths_College|Goldsmiths College]] in the UK, says the appeal of the hoodie is because of its promise of anonymity, mystery and anxiety. "The point of origin is obviously black American [[hip-hop|hip-hop]] culture, now thoroughly mainstream and a key part of the global economy. Leisure and sportswear adopted for everyday wear suggests a distance from the world of office [[suit_(clothing)|suit]] or [[school_uniform|school uniform]]. Rap culture celebrates defiance, as it narrates the experience of [[social_exclusion|social exclusion]]. Musically and stylistically, it projects menace and danger as well as anger and rage. The hooded top is one in a long line of garments chosen by young people, usually boys, to which are ascribed meanings suggesting that they are 'up to no good'. In the past, such appropriation was usually restricted to membership of specific youth cultures—leather jackets, [[bondage_trousers|bondage trousers]]—but nowadays it is the norm among young people to flag up their music and cultural preferences in this way, hence the adoption of the hoodie by boys across the boundaries of age, ethnicity and class."<ref name="guardian 2005">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,3604,1482816,00.html|title=In the hood|publisher=The Guardian|date=2005-05-13 | location=London | first=Gareth | last=McLean | accessdate=2010-05-04}}</ref>

In May 2005, [[Bluewater_(shopping_centre)|Bluewater]] shopping centre in [[Kent|Kent]] caused outrage by launching a code of conduct which bans its shoppers from sporting hoodies or [[baseball_cap|baseball cap]]s, although the garments remain on sale. [[John_Prescott|John Prescott]] welcomed the move, stating that he had felt threatened by the presence of hooded teenagers at a motorway service station.<ref name="guardian 2005" /> Then-[[Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Tony_Blair|Tony Blair]] openly supported this stance and vowed to clamp down on the [[anti-social_behavior|anti-social behaviour]] with which hoodie wearers are sometimes associated.

In 2005, [[Coombeshead_College|Coombeshead College]] in the south-west of England allowed the hoodie to become part of the boys' [[school_uniform|school uniform]], but the hood could be put up only when it rained. The principal, Richard Haigh, stated that the move would help to calm some of what he called the "hysteria" surrounding the garment.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/devon/4562737.stm|title=School adopts 'hoodie' as uniform|publisher=BBC|date=2005-05-19}}</ref>

In February 2006, a 58-year-old teacher who was wearing a hooded top was asked to remove it when entering a [[Tesco|Tesco]] store in [[Swindon|Swindon]].
