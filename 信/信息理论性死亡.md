'''信息理論性死亡'''意指儲存在[[腦部|腦部]]的訊息被摧毀的程度嚴重，乃至於在理論上回復原本人格已是不可能的狀況。

信息理論性死亡是為了提供一種無論未來的醫療技術多麼進步，都能用來定義死亡的定義。因為在現代，關於如何讀取或恢復大腦的訊息儲存架構的細節都尚未有定義，信息理論性死亡這個定義在主流醫學上是不實際的。<ref>{{cite book| title=Connectome: How the Brain's Wiring Makes Us Who We Are |author=[[Sebastian_Seung|Sebastian Seung]] |publisher=Houghton Mifflin | year = 2012| pages = 271| isbn=9780547678597| url=https://books.google.com/?id=GXwEuoYl3wQC&pg=PA271&q=%22information-theoretic%20death%22| quote=Merkle's definition of death is of more philosophical than practical importance. To apply it, we need to know exactly how memories, personality, and other aspects of personal identity are stored in the brain.}}</ref>不過用於期待未來科技的[[人體冷凍技術|人體冷凍技術]]上時，這個定義就很重要。

信息理論性死亡也被稱為「不可逆死亡的終極定義」<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Cerullo MA |title=The Ethics of Exponential Life Extension Through Brain Preservation |journal=Journal of Evolution and Technology| volume=26 | issue=1 |pages=94–105 |date= March 2016 |url=http://jetpress.org/v26.1/cerullo.pdf | quote=This is known as the information-theoretic definition of death and appears to be the ultimate definition of irreversible death.}}</ref>，和因為「腦部的損傷已經造成其內儲存的訊息永遠地消失」而又被稱作「絕對的不可逆死亡」。<ref name=Doyle/>

信息理論性死亡在主流的[[生物倫理學|生物倫理學]]、[[生物學哲學|生物學哲學]]和[[宗教|宗教]]界探討死亡時都有提到。<ref name=Doyle>{{cite journal |vauthors=Doyle DJ |title=Life, Death and Brain Death: A Critical Examination|journal=Ethics in Biology, Engineering and Medicine |volume=2 | issue=1 |pages=11–31 |date= 2011 | doi=10.1615/EthicsBiologyEngMed.2011003293 | quote=In the later case, sometimes called “absolutely irreversible death” or “information theoretic death” destruction of the brain has occurred to such an extreme that any information it may have ever held is irrevocably lost for all eternity.}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| vauthors=Whetstine L, Streat S, Darwin M, Crippen D| title = Review: Pro/con ethics debate: When is dead really dead?| journal = Critical Care| volume = 9|issue=6| pages = 538–542| date = October 2005| pmid=16356234| doi = 10.1186/cc3894| quote=This approach to defining death, which is rooted not in relative, changing technology and vitalistic worldviews, but rather in the fundamentals of physical law, is known as the information theoretic criterion of death.| pmc=1414041}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| vauthors=Crippen DW, Whetstine LM| title = Ethics review: Dark angels – the problem of death in intensive care| journal = Critical Care| volume = 11| issue=1 |pages = 202| date = February 2007| pmid=17254317| doi = 10.1186/cc5138| quote=Cryptographer and nanotechnologist Ralph Merkle noted, “The difference between information theoretic death and clinical death is as great as the difference between turning off a computer and dissolving that computer in acid.| pmc=2151911}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Ali Afzali M |title=Brain death from the perspective of shia and modern medicine |journal=Journal of Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences |volume=24 | issue=113 |pages=221–233 |date=December 2013 |url=http://jmums.mazums.ac.ir/files/site1/user_files_0d0bf0/t_mousavi-A-10-1466-109-afe925d.pdf| quote=The theory of information-theoretical death was introduced, stating that the human brain cell arrangement at one point in time loses its stored information and experiences brain death (translate.reference.com)}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors= Wowk B| title= Special Section.
