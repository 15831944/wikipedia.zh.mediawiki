'''產鉗'''是一種用作協助[[分娩|分娩]]的器具，主要是協助[[難產|難產]]的孕婦。

現代產鉗由英國產科醫生{{le|彼德·張伯倫|Peter Chamberlen}}於1600年左右發明。在最初的一百年，一直為張伯倫家族的家傳秘密。1734年，此項秘密被公開。在之後二百年，成為[[產科|產科]]不可或缺的工具。近數十年，由於[[剖腹生產|剖腹生產]]的盛行，加上{{le|真空牽引|Ventouse}}的發明，產鉗的使用正快速下降。

===Technique===
The [[cervix|cervix]] must be fully dilated and the [[urinary_bladder|bladder]] emptied, perhaps with the use of a [[catheter|catheter]].  Since mid-forceps and high forceps are rarely performed in this era, the station of the head must be at least +2. The woman is placed in the [[lithotomy_position|lithotomy position]] (on her back, usually with the aid of stirrups to support her legs) and a mild [[anesthesia|anaesthetic]] is administered (unless an [[epidural_anesthesia|epidural]] has been given). It is very important that adequate [[pain_control|pain control]] is achieved.  After ascertaining the precise position of the fetal head (by accurately feeling the posterior fontanelle), the two sections of the forceps are individually inserted and then locked into position around the baby's head.  The fetal head is then rotated to occiput [[anterior|anterior]] position if it is not already in this position. An [[episiotomy|episiotomy]] is performed and then the baby is delivered.

===Possible indicating factors===
*[[Fetus|Fetal]] or maternal [[distress|distress]] 
*If the baby is not delivering despite maternal effort
*When (further) pushing is contra-indicated
*[[Arterial_hypertension|Arterial hypertension]] (high blood pressure)

===Comparisons to other forms of assisted delivery===
====Positive aspects====
*Can be performed even if the baby is not in the correct position, although not if the head is presenting high in the vaginal canal
*Can be used to avoid caesarean delivery
*Delivery of the infant can occur more quickly than with emergency caesarean surgery

====Negative aspects====
*An [[episiotomy|episiotomy]] is usually required which itself involves anesthesia
*The internal tissues, particularly the pelvic floor muscles, are bruised
*Women with a previous history of sexual abuse have reported feeling as though they were raped after instrumental deliveries
*A [[rectovaginal_fistula|rectovaginal fistula]] can result, where fecal material leaks from the bowel into the vagina
*Facial bruising or temporary marks on the baby
*Nerve damage
*Skull fractures
*Cervical cord injury to the baby that results in the baby being unable to breathe unassisted
*Brain damage which can cause mild to severe mental retardation; to avoid this, in [[Japan|Japan]] the use of the forceps is forbidden since 1930 and it has been replaced with the surgical enlargement the vagina, with a subsequent radical drop of childbirth injuries in babies.

 a [[cesarean_section|cesarean section]] relatively safely, use of forceps and training in the technique of its use has sharply declined.
