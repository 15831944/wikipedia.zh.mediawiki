'''印度东北部'''是指[[印度|印度]]最东部的区域，包括互相毗邻的[[七姐妹邦|七个邦]]和[[锡金邦|锡金邦]]，其中[[阿魯那恰爾邦|阿魯那恰爾邦]]與中國有領土爭議。<!-- [[Sikkim|Sikkim]] and areas of [[North_Bengal|North Bengal]].  This region is officially recognized as a special category of states. The North East Council (NEC)<ref>[http://necouncil.nic.in/ North East Council]</ref> was constituted in [[1971|1971]] as the nodal agency for the economic and social development of the eight states, the North Eastern Development Finance Corporation Ltd (NEDFi)<ref>[http://www.nedfi.com/about_nedfi.htm North Eastern Development Finance Corporation Ltd.]</ref> was incorporated on [[August_9|August 9]], [[1995|1995]] and the Ministry of Development of Northeastern Region (DONER)<ref>[http://northeast.nic.in/ Ministry of Development of Northeastern Region]</ref><ref>[http://www.northeastvigil.in/facts/?p=116 Ministry of Development of Northeastern Region] from [http://www.northeastvigil.in Northeast Vigil]</ref> was set up in September 2001. -->

其中，锡金在1947年成为印度的保护国，在1975年正式成为印度的一个邦。印度东北部与[[尼泊尔|尼泊尔]]、[[不丹|不丹]]、[[中華人民共和國|中国]]、[[缅甸|缅甸]]和[[孟加拉国|孟加拉国]]接壤。它们与印度其他部分之间以宽度只有21千米的西里古里走廊相连。有时[[北孟加拉|北孟加拉]]的一部分到[[西里古里|西里古里]]以东也被包括进邻近的印度东北部。本地区有几个较大的独立运动（阿萨姆、曼尼普尔）。

以上7个邦总面积262,222平方公里。除去[[阿鲁纳恰尔邦|阿鲁纳恰尔邦]]、[[锡金邦|锡金邦]]的[[大阿萨姆地区|大阿萨姆地区]]面积为171,383平方公里。不包括[[阿鲁纳恰尔邦|阿鲁纳恰尔邦]]的印度东北部面积为178,479平方公里。

印度东北部在行政上属于印度的时间極晚，要到近代英印軍隊進入此地區，才納入印度版圖，在此之前印度東北部實際上為不屬於印度的獨立國家。當地人種和印度其他地方不同，多数是[[蒙古人種|蒙古人種]]，語言屬藏緬與南亞語系。 <!-- [[Assam|Assam]] (which included 印度独立时, [[Nagaland|Nagaland]], [[Mizoram|Mizoram]] and [[Meghalaya|Meghalaya]]) was rarely part of political India for most of its [[History_of_Assam|history]]; [[Manipur|Manipur]] and [[Tripura|Tripura]] were princely states also rarely a part of political India; [[Arunachal_Pradesh|Arunachal Pradesh]] was beyond the outer line of [[British_India|British India]] at the beginning of the [[20th_century|20th century]]; and [[Sikkim|Sikkim]] too was not part of political India. These areas were incorporated into mainstream India during the [[British_Raj|British Raj]] when British colonial authorities annexed traditionally separate border countries into Indian territory to form a buffer between their colony and external powers (ie: [[Assam|Assam]], [[Manipur|Manipur]] and [[Tripura|Tripura]] in the Northeast, and [[Balochistan|Balochistan]] and [[西北边境省|西北边境省]] in the northwest).  After independence in [[1947|1947]], extension of the Indian state and political apparatus has been a challenge.<ref>Verghese, V. G.

<!-- The isolation of the Northeastern states began earlier as a result of British imperialism, when the region was cut-off from its traditional trading partners ([[Bhutan|Bhutan]], [[Myanmar|Myanmar]] and [[Indo-China|Indo-China]]).<ref>Baruah, Sanjib (2004), ''Between South and Southeast Asia Northeast India and Look East Policy'', Ceniseas Paper 4, Guwahati</ref>  In [[1947|1947]] Indian independence and partition made this a landlocked region, exacerbating the isolation that is being recognized lately, but not studied yet.<ref>Verghese, B.

This has kept the Northeast politically and culturally apart from the rest of India.  Although Hindus form majority in this region, the North-east is the primary stronghold of [[Christianity_in_India|Christianity in India]]. This has led to the proliferation of terrorist groups with primarily Christian cadres like the [[NLFT|NLFT]]<ref>[http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/india/states/tripura/terrorist_outfits/NLFT.HTM  National Liberation Front of Tripura] - South Asian Terrorism Portal</ref>, [[National_Democratic_Front_of_Bodoland|NFDB]]<ref>[http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/india/states/assam/terrorist_outfits/Ndfb.htm  National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB) - Terrorist Group of Assam] - South Asia Terrorism Portal</ref> and [[NSCN|NSCN]]<ref>[http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/india/states/nagaland/terrorist_outfits/NSCN_K.HTM  National Socialist Council of Nagaland - Khaplang] - South Asia Terrorism Portal</ref>Due to these factors there is discontent and demands for independence are being raised by the [[Nagaland|Nagas]], [[ULFA|ULFA]], and [[Bodo_(community)|Bodos]].  Soon after [[Sino-Indian_War|Sino-Indian War]] of [[1962|1962]] and especially after the rise of insurgency in the region, security influence on policies has increased.<ref>Sanjib Baruah (2001) ''[http://www.himalmag.com/june2001/essay.html Generals as Governors: The parallel political system of Northeast India], Himal Magazine, June 2001</ref>  

The region is known for its unique culture, handicrafts, martial arts, and scenic beauty. Problems include insurgency, unemployment, drug addiction, and lack of infrastructure.  Since the beginning of the economic liberalization in the [[1990|1990]]s, studies have shown that this region is lagging behind the others in terms of development.<ref name="khanna2005"/> -->
