'''印第安大屠殺'''通常指在歐洲人往[[美洲殖民|美洲殖民]]時歐洲人屠殺[[美洲原住民|美洲原住民]][[印第安人|印第安人]]和印第安人屠殺歐洲白種殖民者的歷史。

==概觀==
到底多少人死于這些種族屠殺是難以確定的，歷史學家William M. Osborn寫的《荒野邊疆：美國印地安戰爭中自[[詹姆斯鎮|詹姆斯鎮]]到[[傷膝河大屠殺|伤膝河]]的的暴行》 搜集了從1511年兩種族首次接觸到1890年西擴終止這段時間内、今日美國本土所有有記錄的歐印暴力衝突，並確認了7193人死于白人的暴行，9156人死于印第安人的暴行。Osborn定義的“暴行”限於謀殺，酷刑，殘害平民、傷者、俘虜的肢體器官。對“暴行”的定義不同也會導致統計數量的不同。
