'''分子中的原子理论'''（'''Atoms in molecules'''，简称'''AIM'''）是[[量子化学|量子化学]]的一个模型。它基于{{link-en|电子密度|electron density}}[[标量场|标量场]]的[[拓扑|拓扑]]性质来描述分子中的[[成键|成键]]。除了成键性质之外，AIM 还根据拓扑性质对全空间进行划分，每个区域内正好包含一个原子核，这种区域给出了[[量子化学|量子化学]]上定义[[原子|原子]]的一种方式。通过对每一区域内进行积分，可以得到单个原子的一系列性质。AIM 方法于上世纪60年代由{{link-en|理查德·贝德|Richard Bader}}提出。在过去的几十年里，AIM 逐渐发展成一种用于解决化学体系中的许多问题的[[理论|理论]]，其应用的广泛性远非之前提出的各种模型或理论所能及。<ref>{{cite book | last = Bader | first = Richard | authorlink = Richard Bader

In QTAIM an [[atom|atom]] is defined as a ''proper open system'', i.e. a system that can share [[energy|energy]] and [[electron_density|electron density]], which is localized in the [[three-dimensional_space|3D]] space. -->在 AIM 中，原子表现电子密度梯度场中的吸引子，因而可以通过梯度场的局域[[曲率|曲率]]来进行定义。这种分析方法一般在文献中称为对电子密度的'''拓扑分析'''，尽管这个词与[[数学|数学]]中的拓扑一词的含义并不相同。

根据 AIM 理论的基本[[原理|原理]]，分子结构由电子密度场上的[[驻点|驻点]]给出。

==主要结果==
AIM 理论的主要结果包括：

* 分子可以人为地划分为各个原子的区域。这些区域之间的分界面为电子密度梯度场的零[[通量|通量]]面。原子的物理性质，包括原子有效电荷、偶极矩和能量等，可以通过采用适当的算符在原子区域内进行积分而得到；
* 当且仅当两个原子之间被一个零通量面分隔开，且该零通量面上有一个(3, −1) 临界点时，认为两个原子间存在键。其中临界点指的是电子密度梯度为零的点。(3, −1) 临界点指的是[[海森矩阵|海森矩阵]]的[[本征值|本征值]]中有两个负值和一个正值的临界点。其中 3 表示海森矩阵的非零本征值的个数，而−1表示本征值的[[符号函数|符号函数]]之和。这个临界点称为'''键临界点'''（'''bond critical point''', '''BCP'''）。换句话说，键临界点就是电子密度标量场上的一阶[[鞍点|鞍点]]。'''键径'''由电子密度梯度场中与键临界点相关联的两个核临界点（即原子核所在位置）指向键临界点两条轨线构成。键径上的每一点在垂直于键径的方向上均为电子密度的极大点。
* 根据电子密度场在键临界点的[[拉普拉斯|拉普拉斯]]的符号，可以把键分为两类：'''闭壳层相互作用'''的拉普拉斯为正，而'''电子共享相互作用'''的拉普拉斯为负。
* 分子成键张力可以用键径与连接两原子核的直线之间的夹角来表征，键径偏离直线越远，表明键中的张力越大。

==Applications==
QTAIM is applied to the description of certain [[crystal|organic crystals]] with unusually short distances between neighboring molecules as observed by [[X-ray_diffraction|X-ray diffraction]]. For example in the [[crystal_structure|crystal structure]] of molecular [[chlorine|chlorine]] the experimental Cl...Cl distance between two molecules is 327 picometres which is less than the sum of the [[van_der_Waals_radius|van der Waals radii]] of 350 picometres. In one Qtaim result 12 bond paths start from each chlorine atom to other chlorine atoms including the other chlorine atom in the molecule. The theory also aims to explain the metallic properties of [[metallic_hydrogen|metallic hydrogen]] in much the same way.
 
The theory is also applied to so-called '''hydrogen-hydrogen bonds''' <ref>''Hydrogen - Hydrogen Bonding: A Stabilizing Interaction in Molecules and Crystals'' Cherif F. Matta, Jesus Hernandez-Trujillo, Ting-Hua Tang,
Richard F. W. Bader Chem. Eur. J. '''2003''', 9, 1940 ± 1951 {{DOI|10.1002/chem.200204626}}</ref> as they occur in molecules such as [[phenanthrene|phenanthrene]] and [[chrysene|chrysene]]. In these compounds the distance between two ortho hydrogen atoms again is shorter than their van der Waals radii and according to [[in_silico|in silico]] experiments based on this theory, a bond path is identified between them. Both hydrogen atoms have identical electron density and are [[Electron_shell|closed shell]] and therefore they are very different from the so-called [[dihydrogen_bond|dihydrogen bond]]s which are postulated for compounds such as (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>NHBH<sub>3</sub> and also different from so-called [[agostic_interaction|agostic interaction]]s.
 
In mainstream chemistry close proximity of two nonbonding atoms leads to destabilizing [[steric_repulsion|steric repulsion]] but in QTAIM the observed hydrogen hydrogen interactions are in fact stabilizing. It is well known that both kinked phenanthrene and chrysene are around 6 [[Calorie|kcal]]/[[mole_(unit)|mol]] (25 [[kilojoule|kJ]]/mol) more stable than their linear [[isomer|isomer]]s [[anthracene|anthracene]] and [[tetracene|tetracene]]. One traditional explanation is given by [[Clar's_rule|Clar's rule]]. QTAIM shows that a calculated stabilization for phenanthrene by 8 kcal/mol (33 kJ/mol) is the result of destabilization of the compound by 8 kcal/mol (33 kJ/mol)  originating from electron transfer from carbon to hydrogen, offset by 12.1 kcal (51 kJ/mol) of stabilization due to a H..H bond path. The electron density at the critical point between the two hydrogen atoms is low, 0.012 e for phenanthrene. Another property of the bond path is its curvature.

Another molecule studied in Qtaim is [[biphenyl|biphenyl]]. Its two phenyl rings are oriented at a 38° angle with respect to each other with the planar [[molecular_geometry|molecular geometry]] (encountered in a rotation around the central C-C bond) destabilized by 2.1 kcal/mol (8.8 kJ/mol) and the perpendicular one destabilized by 2.5 kcal/mol (10.5 kJ/mol). The classic explanations for this rotation barrier are steric repulsion between the ortho-hydrogen atoms (planar) and breaking of [[delocalization|delocalization]] of [[pi_orbital|pi]] density over both rings (perpendicular).  

In QTAIM the energy increase on decreasing the [[dihedral_angle|dihedral angle]] from 38° to 0° is a summation of several factors. Destabilizing factors are the increase in [[bond_length|bond length]] between the connecting carbon atoms (because they have to accommodate the approaching hydrogen atoms) and transfer of electronic charge from carbon to hydrogen. Stabilizing factors are increased delocalization of pi-electrons from one ring to the other and the one that tips the balance is a hydrogen - hydrogen bond between the ortho hydrogens.  
 
The hydrogen bond is not without its critics. According to one the relative stability of phenanthrene compared to its isomers can be adequately explained by comparing resonance stabilizations.<ref>''Molecular Recognition in Organic Crystals: Directed Intermolecular Bonds or Nonlocalized Bonding?'' [[Jack_D._Dunitz|Jack D. Dunitz]] and Angelo Gavezzotti [[Angew._Chem._Int._Ed.|Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.]] '''2005''', 44, 1766–1787 {{DOI|10.1002/anie.200460157}}</ref> Another critic <ref>''Polycyclic Benzenoids: Why Kinked is More Stable than Straight'' Jordi Poater, Ruud Visser, Miquel Sola, F. Matthias Bickelhaupt [[J._Org._Chem.|J. Org. Chem.]] '''2007''', 72, 1134-1142 {{DOI|10.1021/jo061637p}}</ref> argues that the stability of phenanthrene can be attributed to more effective pi-pi overlap in the central double bond; the existence of bond paths are not questioned but the stabilizing energy derived from it is.
