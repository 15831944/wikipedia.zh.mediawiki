'''杜瑞尔獴'''（[[学名|学名]]：''{{lang|la|Salanoia durrelli}}''）是一种分布于[[马达加斯加|马达加斯加]]的哺乳动物，分类学上属于[[食肉目|食肉目]][[食蟻狸科|食蟻狸科]]，和[[純色獴|純色獴]]共同组成了純色獴属。杜瑞尔獴和纯色獴基因上很相似，但是形态上有所区别，因此科学家将其归为不同物种。2004年，科学家观测到杜瑞尔獴的个体，后于2010年将其命名为杜瑞尔獴。杜瑞尔獴仅出现于[[阿劳特拉湖|阿劳特拉湖]]区域。

<!--
A small, reddish-brown carnivore, ''Salanoia durrelli'' is characterized by broad feet with prominent [[肉垫|Paw#Common characteristics]], reddish-[[wikt:buff|buff]] underparts, and broad, robust teeth, among other differences from the brown-tailed mongoose. In the only two weighed specimens, body mass was {{convert|600|and|675|g|oz|abbr=on}}. It is a marsh-dwelling animal that may feed on [[crustacea|crustacea]]ns and [[mollusk|mollusk]]s. The Lac Alaotra area is a threatened ecosystem, and ''S. durrelli'' may also be endangered by competition with [[外來物種|introduced species]].

==Taxonomy==
An individual ''Salanoia durrelli'' was observed swimming in 2004 by the [[Durrell_Wildlife_Conservation_Trust|Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust]] (DWCT) during a survey of [[馴狐猴屬|bamboo lemur]]s (''Hapalemur'') in the [[阿劳特拉湖|Lake Alaotra]] area, the largest [[湿地|wetland]]s of Madagascar. The animal was captured, photographed, and then released, but examination of the photograph showed that it could not be identified with any known species of Malagasy carnivoran (family [[食蟻狸科|Eupleridae]]). Therefore, two specimens were caught in 2005 by the DWCT. One was killed to facilitate additional morphological comparisons.<ref name=Dea342>Durbin et al., 2010, p. 342</ref>  In 2010, it was formally described as ''Salanoia durrelli'' in a paper by conservationist Joanna Durbin and a team of scientists from the [[Climate,_Community_&_Biodiversity_Alliance|Climate, Community & Biodiversity Alliance]], [[Nature_Heritage|Nature Heritage]], the [[自然史博物馆_(伦敦)|Natural History Museum, London]], [[保護國際|Conservation International]], and the DWCT.<ref name=Dea341>Durbin et al., 2010, p. 341</ref> The [[种加词|specific name (zoology)]], ''durrelli'', honors [[Gerald_Durrell|Gerald Durrell]], a noted conservationist and the founder of the DWCT.<ref name=Dea346>Durbin et al., 2010, p. 346</ref> Previously, local villagers had already reported the presence of a small carnivoran at Alaotra, and it was speculated that the animal was the closely related [[純色獴|brown-tailed mongoose]] (''Salanoia concolor'').<ref>Garbutt, 1999, p. 140</ref>

''Salanoia durrelli'' was placed in the genus ''[[Salanoia|Salanoia]]'', which previously included only the brown-tailed mongoose of eastern Madagascar. ''S. durrelli'' shows substantial [[morphology_(anatomy)|morphological]] differences from the brown-tailed mongoose, but the [[线粒体DNA|mitochondrial DNA]] of the two species is very similar.<ref>Durbin et al., 2010, pp. 345–346</ref> The discoverers chose to recognize the Lac Alaotra population as a separate species in view of its significant morphological differentiation. The observed morphological distinctiveness might be result of  [[適應|adaptation]]s to life in the Alaotra wetlands, similar to the Alaotra bamboo lemur species, ''[[Hapalemur_alaotrensis|Hapalemur alaotrensis]]'', which is also recognized as a distinct species despite being genetically close to the more widespread ''[[Hapalemur_griseus|Hapalemur griseus]]''.<ref>Durbin et al., 2010, pp. 351–352</ref>

==Description==
''Salanoia durrelli'' most closely resembles the brown-tailed mongoose,<ref name=Dea342/> which is a small, [[wikt:gracile|gracile]] [[獴科|mongoose]]-like carnivoran.<ref>Garbutt, 2007, p. 219</ref> It is reddish-brown overall, paler than the brown-tailed mongoose.<ref name=Dea348>Durbin et al., 2010, p. 348</ref> The head and [[nape|nape]] are speckled.<ref name=Dea346/> The underparts are reddish-[[wikt:buff|buff]], not brownish as in the brown-tailed mongoose.<ref name=Dea348/> Most of the tail is similar in color to the body, but the tip is yellowish-brown. The inner side of the well-furred external ear ([[pinna_(anatomy)|pinna]]) is reddish-buff. The broad feet are naked below, with the naked skin buff on the forefeet and dark brown on the hindfeet, and show prominent [[肉垫|Paw#Common characteristics]]. Each of the five digits on the fore- and hindfeet bears a long, dark brown claw. There are rows of stiff hairs along the outer margins of the feet.<ref name=Dea346/> In contrast, the brown-tailed mongoose has narrower feet with more poorly developed pads.<ref name=Dea348/> In ''S. durrelli'', the fur is long and soft.<ref name=Dea346/>
[[File:Galidia_olivacea_Geoffroy.png|thumb]] (''Salanoia concolor''), the closest relative of ''S. durrelli'' (the tail in this plate is incomplete)<ref>Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, 1839; cf. Garbutt, 2007, pp. 219–220</ref>]]

In the [[正模標本|holotype]] specimen, a female, the head and body length was {{convert|310|mm|in|abbr=on}}, the tail length was {{convert|210|mm|in|abbr=on}}, the hindfoot length was {{convert|66.8|mm|in|abbr=on}}, the ear length was {{convert|17.5|mm|in|abbr=on}}, and the body mass was {{convert|675|g|oz|abbr=on}}. In another specimen, a male which was captured and released, the head and body length was about {{convert|330|mm|in|abbr=on}}, the tail length was about {{convert|175|mm|in|abbr=on}}, and the body mass was {{convert|600|g|oz|abbr=on}}.<ref name=Dea346/> Based on these limited data, ''S. durrelli'' may be slightly smaller than the brown-tailed mongoose.<ref name=Dea348/>

The skull generally resembles that of the brown-tailed mongoose, but the rostrum (front part) is broad and deep, the [[鼻骨|nasal bone]]s are broad and short, and the region of the [[腭|palate]] is broad. The [[mandible|mandible]] (lower jaw) is robust and shows a high, steeply rising [[coronoid_process_of_the_mandible|coronoid process]] (a projection at the back of the bone).<ref name=Dea348/> Statistical analysis of measurements of the skulls and teeth strongly separates ''S. durrelli'' from specimens of the brown-tailed mongoose.<ref name=Dea344>Durbin et al., 2010, p. 344</ref>

''Salanoia durrelli'' has a more robust [[齒列|dentition]] than the brown-tailed mongoose; the teeth have larger surface areas.<ref name=Dea348/> The first and second upper [[門齒|incisor]]s are smaller than the third, which is separated by a pronounced [[diastema_(dentistry)|diastema]] (gap) from the [[犬齒|canine tooth]].<ref name=Dea347>Durbin et al., 2010, p. 347</ref> The canine is more robust than in the brown-tailed mongoose. The first upper [[premolar|premolar]] is small, but the second and third are larger; these two teeth are shorter and broader than in the brown-tailed mongoose.<ref name=Dea349>Durbin et al., 2010, p. 349</ref> The fourth premolar is large, as is the first molar.<ref name=Dea347/> The second upper molar is less than one-third the size of the first, and is more highly reduced than that of the brown-tailed mongoose, which is about two-thirds the size of the first molar.<ref name=Dea349/> The first lower incisor is smaller than the other two. The lower canine, premolars, and first molar are well-developed. The second molar is broad,<ref name=Dea347/> but smaller than in the brown-tailed mongoose.<ref name=Dea349/>

==Distribution, habitat, and behavior==
''Salanoia durrelli'' has been recorded at Andreba, a marshy area at {{convert|750|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level on the eastern coast of Lac Alaotra.<ref name=Dea346/> The nearest occurrence of the brown-tailed mongoose is about {{convert|55|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Alaotra. The first observed specimen was swimming; it may have fled from human activity on the shore. The two others were caught on mats of floating vegetation. Thus, ''S. durrelli'' occurs in a marsh habitat—quite different from the forest-dwelling brown-tailed mongoose. ''S. durrelli'' may use its robust dentition to feed on prey with hard parts, such as [[crustacea|crustacea]]ns and [[mollusc|mollusc]]s, in addition to small [[脊椎动物|vertebrate]]s, rather than the insects that the more gracile-toothed brown-tailed mongoose eats. Indeed, the two specimens of ''S. durrelli'' were captured using traps baited with fish and meat. ''S. durrelli'' is similar in many respects to the larger mainland African [[沼澤獴|marsh mongoose]] (''Atilax paludinosa''), a carnivorous wetland-dweller that also uses mats of vegetation to eat and sleep on.<ref name=Dea350>Durbin et al., 2010, p. 350</ref>

==Conservation status==
The unique habitat of Lac Alaotra is threatened by pollution, destruction of marshes for the construction of rice fields, overfishing, and [[外來物種|introduced species]] such as exotic fish, plants, the [[黑鼠|black rat]] (''Rattus rattus''), and the [[小靈貓|small Indian civet]] (''Viverricula indica''), another small carnivoran.<ref name=Dea352/> A bird restricted to the area, the [[德氏小鸊鷉|Alaotra grebe]] (''Tachybaptus rufolavatus''), was declared extinct in 2010<ref>BirdLife International, 2010</ref> and the population of the bamboo lemur fell by about 30% from 1994 to 1999.<ref>Mutschler et al., 2001</ref> As a narrowly distributed species with a small population, ''S. durrelli'' is likely to be threatened by degradation of its habitat and perhaps competition with the small Indian civet and the black rat, but its [[保护状况|conservation status]] has not yet been formally assessed. The DWCT is working to conserve the Lac Alaotra area and the region has been designated as a [[保护区|protected area]].<ref name=Dea352>Durbin et al., 2010, p. 352</ref>
