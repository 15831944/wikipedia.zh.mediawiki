==历史==   

===1960s: Origin; 1970s: Market entrenchment===
The term "minicomputer" evolved in the [[1960s|1960s]] to describe the "small" third generation computers that became possible with the use of [[transistor|transistor]] and [[core_memory|core memory]] technologies. The term came in fashion about the same time as the [[miniskirt|miniskirt]] and [[mini|mini]] cars. They usually took up one or a few cabinets the size of a large refrigerator or two, compared with [[mainframe_computer|mainframes]] that would usually fill a room. The first successful minicomputer was [[Digital_Equipment_Corporation|Digital Equipment Corporation]]'s 12-bit [[PDP-8|PDP-8]], which cost from [[United_States_dollar|US$]]16,000 upwards when launched in [[1964|1964]].   The important precursors of the PDP-8 include the [[LINC|LINC]], the [[TX-0|TX-0]], the [[TX-2|TX-2]], and the [[PDP-1|PDP-1]].

The [[7400_series|7400 series]] of [[transistor-transistor_logic|TTL]] [[integrated_circuit|integrated circuit]]s started appearing in minicomputers in the late [[1960|1960]]s. The 74181 [[arithmetic-logic_unit|arithmetic-logic unit]] (ALU) was commonly used in the [[central_processing_unit|CPU]] data paths.  Each 74181 had a bus width of four bits, hence the popularity of ''bit-slice'' architecture. The 7400 series offered data-selectors, [[multiplexer|multiplexer]]s, three-state buffers, memories, etc. in [[dual_in-line_package|dual in-line package]]s with one-tenth inch spacing, making major system components and architecture evident to the naked eye. (Starting in the [[1980|1980]]s, many minicomputers used [[VLSI|VLSI]] circuits (Very Large Scale Integration), often making the hardware organization much less apparent.)

As microcomputers developed in the [[1970s|1970s]] and [[1980s|80s]], minicomputers filled the mid-range area between low powered microcomputers and high capacity mainframes. At the time microcomputers were single-user, relatively simple machines running simple program-launcher operating systems like [[CPM_operating_system|CP/M]] or [[MS-DOS|MS-DOS]], while minis were much more powerful systems that ran full multi-user, multitasking operating systems like [[OpenVMS|VMS]] and [[Unix|Unix]], often with [[time-sharing|timesharing]] versions of [[BASIC|BASIC]] for application development ([[MAI_Basic_4|MAI Basic 4]] systems being very popular in that regard). The classical mini was a [[16-bit|16-bit]] computer, while the emerging higher performance [[32-bit|32-bit]] minis were often referred to as [[supermini|supermini]]s.

===Mid-1980s, 1990s: The minis give way to the micros===
The decline of the minis happened due to the lower cost of microprocessor based [[computer_hardware|hardware]], the emergence of inexpensive and easily deployable [[local_area_network|local area network]] systems, and the desire of end-users to be less reliant on inflexible minicomputer manufacturers and IT departments/"data centers"—with the result that minicomputers and [[dumb_terminal|dumb terminal]]s were replaced by networked [[workstation|workstation]]s and [[IBM_PC_compatible|PC]]s in the latter half of the [[1980s|1980s]].   

During the [[1990s|1990s]] the change from minicomputers to inexpensive PC networks was cemented by the development of several versions of [[Unix|Unix]] to run on the [[Intel|Intel]] [[x86|x86]] microprocessor [[computer_architecture|architecture]], including [[Solaris_Operating_Environment|Solaris]], [[Linux|Linux]], [[FreeBSD|FreeBSD]], [[NetBSD|NetBSD]] and [[OpenBSD|OpenBSD]]. Also, the Microsoft Windows series of operating systems now includes server versions that support preemptive multitasking and other features required for servers, beginning with [[Windows_NT|Windows NT]].

As [[microprocessor|microprocessor]]s have become more powerful, [[central_processing_unit|CPUs]] built up from multiple components—once the distinguishing feature differentiating mainframes and midrange systems from microcomputers—have become increasingly obsolete, even in the largest [[mainframe_computer|mainframe computer]]s.

[[Digital_Equipment_Corporation|Digital Equipment Corporation]] was the leading minicomputer manufacturer, at one time the 2nd largest computer company after [[IBM|IBM]]. But as the minicomputer declined in the face of generic UNIX servers and Intel based PCs, not only DEC, but almost every other minicomputer company  including [[Data_General|Data General]], [[Prime_Computer|Prime]], [[Computervision|Computervision]], [[Honeywell|Honeywell]] and [[Wang_Computer|Wang Computer]], many based in [[New_England|New England]] also collapsed. DEC was sold to Compaq in 1998.

===The minicomputer's industrial impact and heritage===
Several pioneering computer companies first built minicomputers, such as DEC, [[Data_General|Data General]], and [[Hewlett-Packard|Hewlett-Packard (HP)]] (who now refers to its HP3000 minicomputers as "servers" rather than "minicomputers"). And although today's PCs and servers are clearly microcomputers physically, architecturally their CPUs and operating systems have evolved largely by integrating features from minicomputers.

In the software context, the first microcomputer operating system, [[CP/M|CP/M]] was an implementation of a DEC PDP-11 operating system for the 8080 and Z80 processors. DOS, which gives its command line to Windows, was an unauthorized port / redesign of CP/M for the 8086. The [[Windows_NT|Windows NT]] operating system was headed by a designer from [[Digital_Equipment_Corporation|DEC]] responsible for the [[Virtual_Memory_System|VMS]] OS for the [[VAX|VAX]] minicomputer range in the 1970s, and adopted features from UNIX which ran largely on minicomputers.

Today at the turn of the millennium few minicomputers are still in use, having been overtaken by Fourth Generation computers built using a more robust version of the [[microprocessor|microprocessor]] technology that is used in personal computers. These are referred to as "[[Server_(computing)|server]]s", taking the name from the server software that they run (typically file server and back-end database software, including [[email|email]] and [[web_server|web server]] software).
