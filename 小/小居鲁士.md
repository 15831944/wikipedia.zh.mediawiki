小居鲁士的故事和希腊人的撤退的事情被记录在[[色诺芬|色诺芬]]所著的''[[远征记|远征记]]''。 其他的一些记载, 可能来自Sophaenetus of Stymphalus, 曾被[[埃福罗斯|埃福罗斯]]摘录过。更多的信息来自亞他薛西斯二世的医生, [[克特西亚斯|克特西亚斯]], 由[[佛提乌|佛提乌]]摘录；[[普鲁塔克|普鲁塔克]]所著的《亞他薛西斯二世和吕山德的生活》；以及[[修昔底德|修昔底德]]所著的《伯罗奔尼撒战争史》。<ref name=Thucydides>{{cite book|last=Strassler|first=R.B.|title=The Landmark Thucydides: A Comprehensive Guide to the Peloponnesian War|year=1996|publisher=Free Press New York|isbn=0-684-82790-5|pages=128, 549}}</ref> 这些是仅有的关于小居鲁士的早期来源。

==传记==
据色诺芬记载, 小居鲁士出生在他父亲登基<ref>约公元前424年</ref>之后。{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} 他有一个哥哥, Arsicas (登基之后改稱「亞他薛西斯二世」), 以及2个名叫Ostanes和Oxathres的弟弟。关于居鲁士的幼年 [[普鲁塔克|普鲁塔克]]写道：「居鲁士自幼就展现了刚愎自用和暴躁的性格；亞他薛西斯则是另一面，任何事情上都显得很优雅, 能屈能伸。」<ref name="Plutarch's Artaxerxes">Plutarch.

Nor less in matters of war, in the use of the bow and the javelin, was he held by men in general to be at once the aptest of learners and the most eager practiser. As soon as his age permitted, the same pre-eminence showed itself in his fondness for the chase, not without a certain appetite for perilous adventure in facing the wild beasts themselves. Once a bear made a furious rush at him, and without wincing he grappled with her, and was pulled from his horse, receiving wounds the scars of which were visible through life; but in the end he slew the creature, nor did he forget him who first came to his aid, but made him enviable in the eyes of many.</ref><ref name="Xenophon">Xenophon.

公元前408年, 在[[阿尔西比亚德斯|阿尔西比亚德斯]]胜利之后, 大流士二世决定继续和[[雅典|雅典]]的战争并且给予斯巴达人强有力的支持。他命小居鲁士去[[小亚细亚|小亚细亚]]作为[[吕底亚|吕底亚]]和[[弗里几亚|弗里几亚]][[总督|总督]]主要在[[卡帕多细亚|卡帕多细亚]]，成为那边波斯军队的统帅, "小亚细亚地区的军队聚集在Castolos旷野"。{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} 这里,居鲁士会见了斯巴达将领吕山德。 在他身上,居鲁士发现这个男人愿意支持自己成为王, 就像吕山德希望在波斯王子的支持下成为希腊的绝对统治者。因此，居鲁士全力支持[[伯罗奔尼撒战争|伯罗奔尼撒战争]]中的吕山德,可是拒绝他的继任者[[卡利克拉提达斯|卡利克拉提达斯]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

在那期间, 大流士病倒了，临终前把他的孩子叫到自己身边；<ref>Xenophon. Tr. H. G. Dakyns. ''Anabasis'' I.I. [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1170/1170-h/1170-h.htm Project Gutenberg].</ref> 居鲁士把钱给了吕山德然后去了[[苏萨|苏萨]].<ref>Plutarch.

大流士死后不久，前404年在亞他薛西斯二世登基期间，{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} [[替萨斐尼|替萨斐尼]] (Ciθrafarna) 指责居鲁士想要暗杀他的兄弟, 然后居鲁士被逮捕了, 可是在[[帕瑞萨娣丝|帕瑞萨娣丝]]的乞求下,居鲁士被赦免并送回了他的总督区。 根据普鲁塔克所记,他的这次被捕的怨恨使得他比以前更迫切渴望得到这个国家<ref name="Plutarch's Artaxerxes" />

吕山德赢得了[[伊哥斯波塔米戰役|伊哥斯波塔米戰役]], 之后斯巴达在希腊世界里变的更有影响力了。居鲁士计划扩充军队在同总督[[卡里亚|卡里亚]][[提萨斐尼|提萨斐尼]]争执之后 , about the [[Ionia|Ionia]]n towns; 他也假装准备远征[[皮西迪亚|皮西迪亚]]人, 一个从未臣服于帝国多的活动于[[托鲁斯山脉|托鲁斯山脉]]的山地部落。{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

{{ transH }}

前401年春, Cyrus united all his forces into an army now including Xenophon's "[[Ten_Thousand_(Greek)|Ten Thousand]]", and advanced from [[Sardis|Sardis]] without announcing the object of his expedition. By dexterous management and large promises, he overcame the misgivings of the Greek troops over the length and danger of the war; a Spartan fleet of thirty-five [[trireme|trireme]]s sent to [[Cilicia|Cilicia]] opened the passes of the [[Amanus|Amanus]] into [[Syria|Syria]] and conveyed to him a Spartan detachment of 700 men under Cheirisophus. The king had only been warned at the last moment by Tissaphernes and gathered an army in haste; Cyrus advanced into Babylonia before he met with an enemy. In October 401 BC, the [[battle_of_Cunaxa|battle of Cunaxa]] ensued. Cyrus had 10,400 Greek [[hoplite|hoplite]]s (citizen-soldiers), 2,500 [[peltast|peltast]]s (light infantry), and an Asiatic army of approximately 10,000 under the command of [[Ariaeus|Ariaeus]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

居鲁士看到结果依赖于王的命运; he therefore wanted [[Clearchus_of_Sparta|Clearchus]], 希腊人的统帅， to take the centre against Artaxerxes. Clearchus, out of arrogance, disobeyed. As a result, the left wing of the Persians under Tissaphernes was free to engage the rest of Cyrus' forces; Cyrus in the centre threw himself upon Artaxerxes but was slain. Tissaphernes claimed to have killed the rebel himself, and Parysatis later took vengeance upon the slayer of her favorite son.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} The Persian troops, instead of attacking the Greeks via a direct assault, decoyed them into the interior, beyond the [[Tigris|Tigris]], and then attacked through trickery. It was a solid and clever plan, but after their commanders had been taken prisoners, the Greeks managed to force their way to the [[Black_Sea|Black Sea]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

==色诺芬对居鲁士生活的摘录==
[[File:Persian_Empire,_490_BC.png|thumb]]]]

色诺芬写道那些认识居鲁士的人都认为居鲁士是自居鲁士大帝以来最具有王的品质的人并对他有极大的赞扬<ref>After he had been sent down by his father to be satrap of Lydia and Great Phrygia and Cappadocia, and had been appointed general of the forces, whose business it is to muster in the plain of the Castolus, nothing was more noticeable in his conduct than the importance which he attached to the faithful fulfillment of every treaty or compact or undertaking entered into with others. He would tell no lies to any one. Thus doubtless it was that he won the confidence alike of individuals and of the communities entrusted to his care; or in case of hostility, a treaty made with Cyrus was a guarantee sufficient to the combatant that he would suffer nothing contrary to its terms. Therefore, in the war with Tissaphernes, all the states of their own accord chose Cyrus in lieu of Tissaphernes, except only the men of Miletus, and these were only alienated through fear of him, because he refused to abandon their exiled citizens; and his deeds and words bore emphatic witness to his principle: even if they were weakened in number or in fortune, he would never abandon those who had once become his friends.He made no secret of his endeavour to outdo his friends and his foes alike in reciprocity of conduct. The prayer has been attributed to him, "God grant I may live along enough to recompense my friends and requite my foes with a strong arm."</ref>

根据色诺芬的说法, 他的正直给他赢得了很多追随者的忠诚和爱戴<ref>Many were the gifts bestowed on him, for many and diverse reasons; no one man, perhaps, ever received more; no one, certainly, was ever more ready to bestow them upon others, with an eye ever to the taste of each, so as to gratify what he saw to be the individual requirement. Many of these presents were sent to him to serve as personal adornments of the body or for battle; and as touching these he would say, "How am I to deck myself out in all these? To my mind a man's chief ornament is the adornment of nobly-adorned friends." Indeed, that he should triumph over his friends in the great matters of welldoing is not surprising, seeing that he was much more powerful than they, but that he should go beyond them in minute attentions, and in an eager desire to give pleasure, seems to me, I must confess, more admirable. Frequently when he had tasted some specially excellent wine, he would send the half remaining flagon to some friend with a message to say: "Cyrus says, this is the best wine he has tasted for a long time, that is his excuse for sending it to you. He hopes you will drink it up to-day with a choice party of friends." Or, perhaps, he would send the remainder of a dish of geese, half loaves of bread, and so forth, the bearer being instructed to say: "This is Cyrus's favourite dish, he hopes you will taste it yourself." Or, perhaps, there was a great dearth of provender, when, through the number of his servants and his own careful forethought, he was enabled to get supplies for himself; at such times he would send to his friends in different parts, bidding them feed their horses on his hay, since it would not do for the horses that carried his friends to go starving. Then, on any long march or expedition, where the crowd of lookers-on would be large, he would call his friends to him and entertain them with serious talk, as much as to say, "These I delight to honour."</ref>

==普鲁塔克对居鲁士死亡的描写==
According to the chapter on Artaxerxes II in ''[[Plutarch|Plutarch]]'s Life,'' a young Persian soldier named [[Mithridates_(soldier)|Mithridates]] unknowingly struck Cyrus the Younger during the [[Battle_of_Cunaxa|Battle of Cunaxa]] ([[Greek_language|Greek]]: Κούναξα), making him fall from his horse, 昏倒. 一些阉人发现了居鲁士并尝试把他带到安全的地方, but a Caunian among the king's camp followers struck a vein behind his knee with a dart, making him fall and strike his head on a stone, 于是他死了。 Unwisely, Mithridates boasted of killing Cyrus in the court, and Parysatis had him executed by [[scaphism|scaphism]]. She likewise got vengeance on Masabates, the king's eunuch, who had cut off Cyrus' hand and head, by winning him from her son Artaxerxes in a game of dice and having him flayed alive.<ref name="Plutarch's Artaxerxes" />

==Modern appearances==

[[Michael_Curtis_Ford|Michael Curtis Ford]] - ''The Ten Thousand'' - a historical novel about the 10,000 Greek mercenaries who made up the core of Cyrus's army.

Michael G. Thomas - ''Black Legion: Gates of Cilicia'' - a science fiction retelling of the tale of ''Anabasis''. The Black Legion series closely follows the original historical narrative with most of the characters retained.

[[Robin_Waterfield|Robin Waterfield]] - ''Xenophon's Retreat: Greece, Persia, and the End of the Golden Age'' (London: Faber and Faber Ltd., 2006) is a summary of Xenophon's ''Anabasis'' or ''The Expedition of Cyrus''.

It is recently believed that the [[Gur-e-Dokhtar|Gur-e-Dokhtar]] could be the tomb meant for Cyrus the Younger, after the iron clamps of the monument were studied.
