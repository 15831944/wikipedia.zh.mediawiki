==背景==
<!---
When [[英格蘭足球總會|the Football Association]] (FA) was formed in 1863, its geographical remit was not clear: there was no specification of whether it covered just England, the entire UK or even the entire world. The question was answered when the [[蘇格蘭足球協會|Scottish Football Association]] (SFA) was founded in 1873.  The third national football association, the [[威爾斯足球協會|Football Association of Wales]] was founded in 1876 and a fourth, the [[北愛爾蘭足球協會|Irish Football Association]], (IFA), was founded in 1880.
Football therefore developed with separate national teams representing separate associations for each of the [[英國的構成國|countries of the United Kingdom]] and no 'United Kingdom football association' was ever formed. Whilst a [[英国奥林匹克足球队|team selected by the FA]], sometimes including players from outside England,<ref>[http://infotrac.galegroup.com/itw/infomark/317/433/76363600w16/purl=rc1_TTDA_0_CS251877231&dyn=5!xrn_3_0_CS251877231&hst_1?sw_aep=duruni Modest Hopes of British XI at Melbourne] [[泰晤士报|The Times]]; 15 November 1956; Subscription</ref>   did represent the UK at men's Olympic football between 1908 and 1972, the UK had stopped entering teams into the [[夏季奥林匹克运动会足球比赛|Olympic football tournament]] by the time of the [[1996年夏季奥林匹克运动会足球比赛|first women's football competition]] at the [[1996年夏季奥林匹克运动会|1996 Games]].

Due to London's [[London_2012_Olympic_bid|successful bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics]], the United Kingdom had the right to enter a team in the football tournament as host nation. The [[英國奧林匹克委員會|British Olympic Association]] stated it would enter a football team,<ref> [http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/olympics_2012/5394710.stm 'GB football team to enter Games'], [[BBC體育|BBC Sport]], 30 September 2006.</ref> but the [[蘇格蘭足球協會|Scottish Football Association]] (SFA) refused even to attend meetings at which the [[Home_Nations|Home Nations]] were to discuss the possibility<ref name="No Scots for GB Olympic football">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/4426566.stm No Scots for GB Olympic football], [[BBC體育|BBC Sport]], 11 November 2005.</ref> and the [[威爾斯足球協會|Football Association of Wales]] withdrew from the negotiations.<ref name="Wales oppose GB Olympic Football">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/4427504.stm Wales oppose GB Olympic football], [[BBC體育|BBC Sport]], 6 December 2005.</ref> In October 2007 the [[北愛爾蘭足球協會|Irish Football Association]] (the association for Northern Ireland) also announced that they would not take part in a unified team, leaving [[英格蘭足球總會|the Football Association]] (England) as the only association willing to take part. It was reported that the other associations feared the loss of their privileged voting position within the [[國際足球協會理事會|International Football Association Board]].<ref name="little"> {{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/sep/04/kim-little-great-britain-olympics |title=Scotland's Kim Little wants to play for Great Britain at 2012 Olympics |publisher=[[衛報|The Guardian]]|author=Tony Leighton |date=4 September 2011|accessdate= 26 November 2011 |location=London}}</ref><ref> {{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/19/sports/soccer/even-for-olympic-soccer-uniting-britain-may-be-tough.html?pagewanted=all |title=A British Soccer Team?

Having reached the quarter-finals of the [[2007年國際足協女子世界盃|2007 FIFA Women's World Cup]], England qualified for the Olympic tournament, as they had in 1996. However, they were unable to take their place at the [[2008年夏季奥林匹克运动会|2008 Games in Beijing]] after the national football associations failed to reach an agreement on whether they could play.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/women/7127341.stm Caborn blasts women's Games snub], [[BBC體育|BBC Sport]], 4 December 2007.</ref><ref> [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/olympics/2328845/British-Olympic-Associations-political-own-goal.html British Olympic Association's political own goal] Mott, Sue.
