'''转基因食品争议'''（英語：Genetically modified food controversies）是指关于食用[[转基因作物|转基因作物]]及其副产品、在食品生产中利用[[基因工程|基因工程]]技术等方面的争议。这场争议与消费者、生物技术公司、政府管理者、非政府组织和科学家都密切相关。关于[[基因改造食品|基因改造食品]]的争论核心包括：转基因食品的上市标注、政府管理者的责任、相关科学研究的目的、转基因作物对环境和健康的影响、对害虫之抗药性的影响、对农业生产者的影响和转基因作物对满足全球粮食需求的作用。

科学界的共识是此类转基因作物及其副产品的健康安全风险并不高于传统食品<ref name="AAAS">American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), Board of Directors (2012).

National Academies Press. pp R9-10: 「相比传统食物生产造成的健康危害，类似的严重健康影响还没能被证明同样会由转基因技术产生。这可能是因为转基因生物的研发者进行了大量分析，验证每个生物表现型都是令人满意的，并确保食物关键成分中不会产生不在计划中的变化。」 （"In contrast to adverse health effects that have been associated with some traditional food production methods, similar serious health effects have not been identified as a result of genetic engineering techniques used in food production. This may be because developers of bioengineered organisms perform extensive compositional analyses to determine that each phenotype is desirable and to ensure that unintended changes have not occurred in key components of food."）</ref><ref name="Key">{{cite journal | author = Key S, Ma JK, Drake PM | title = Genetically modified plants and human health | journal = J R Soc Med | volume = 101 | issue = 6 | pages = 290–8 |date=June 2008 | pmid = 18515776 | pmc = 2408621 | doi = 10.1258/jrsm.2008.070372 | quote = +pp 292-293. 「超过15年间，转基因作物及其副产品被全世界千百万人消费，没有造成疾病效应。」（"Foods derived from GM crops have been consumed by hundreds of millions of people across the world for more than 15 years, with no reported ill effects (or legal cases related to human health)."） }}</ref>，但公众还是担心转基因食品有害健康。虽然针对转基因生物产品的标注在许多国家是强制性的，但美国和加拿大并不执行类似政策，在市场上转基因食品和传统食品是没有差别的。
