{{死刑}}

'''掛拉分'''（Hanged, drawn and quartered），又稱為'''英式[[車裂|車裂]]'''，是一種中世紀[[英格兰|英格蘭]]的[[死刑|極刑]]，將犯人以酷刑的方式處死。受刑人將會先被綁在木板或是木架上並拖行到行刑地點，將之[[绞刑|吊]]至半死但保留意識，接著開始[[閹割|閹割]]（{{link-en|完全去勢|Emasculation}}）並{{link-en|開腸剖腹|Disembowelment}}且於其眼前丟至火中燃燒，最後再[[斬首|斬首]]。結束之後，受刑人的頭顱一般會被公開展示以示警（如刺於[[倫敦橋|倫敦橋]]上），而其餘肢體則會被支解為四分並「送至英格蘭國土的四個角落」。

受刑人一般為[[叛國|叛國]]罪（包括謀殺君主），但女性犯人一般則是處以[[火刑|火刑]]。受刑人則有可能因國王予以減刑為[[斬首|斬首]]，如[[亨利八世|亨利八世]]的朝臣{{link-en|湯瑪斯·卡爾佩伯|Thomas Culpeper}}。

此刑罰亦會用在死屍上，如於17世紀[[三國之戰|三國之戰]]（[[英國內戰|英格蘭內戰]]）結束之後，由於[[护国公|護國公]][[奥利弗·克伦威尔|奧利弗·克倫威爾]]將[[查理一世_(英格蘭)|查理一世]]處決，因此[[查理二世_(英格兰)|查理二世]]在王權[[復辟|復辟]]之後將當時已死數年的克倫威爾[[遺體|屍體]]掘出並以掛拉分之方式[[戮屍|戮屍]]。

處決於1817年的{{link-en|耶利米·布蘭德雷斯|Jeremiah Brandreth}}為英國史上記載的最後一名受刑人。關於此刑被廢除的年份，史料考證並不一致，但在1870年以後已不再出現於[[英国|英國]][[法律|法律]]中。

==歷史==
1681年7月，{{tsl|en|Popish Polt|天主教陰謀事件}}的一名處決者——{{tsl|en|Archbishop of Armagh|阿馬大主教}}{{tsl|en|Oliver Plunkett|奧利弗·普蘭克特}}（{{Lang|en|Oliver Plunkett}}），在泰伯恩（{{Lang|en|Tyburn}}）被處以英式車裂。將他處刑的劊子手被賄賂了，以便在火堆中將普蘭克特的身體部位取出。其頭部現在在[[德羅赫達|德羅赫達]]的{{tsl|en|St. Peter's Roman Catholic Church, Drogheda|聖彼得教堂 (德羅赫達)|聖彼得教堂}}中展出。<ref>{{Citation | last = Hanly | first = John | title = Plunket, Oliver <nowiki>[St Oliver Plunket]</nowiki> (1625–1681) | volume = 1 | work = Oxford Dictionary of National Biography | publisher = Oxford University Press, hosted at oxforddnb.com | origyear = 2004 | year = 2006 | url = http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/22412 | accessdate = 17 Aug 2010 | doi = 10.1093/ref:odnb/22412}} {{ODNBsub}}</ref>
