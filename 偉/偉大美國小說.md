'''偉大美國小說'''為代表[[美國|美國]]的[[時代精神|時代精神]]，是準確的主題的小說。它被假定為一個美國[[作家|作家]]以普通美國公民的角度，來了解[[國家|國家]]、[[文化|文化]]。在歷史上，它有時也等同於美國的[[民族史詩|民族史詩]]。

==概述==
雖然小說早在17世紀的美國殖民時期就已經出現，但是不具有“美國”小說的身分，直到“美國文學” 於18世紀開始為止。美國是一個國家，同時反映其文學的發展。

“偉大美國小說”的稱呼源於美國[[南北戰爭|南北戰爭]]時期[[小說家|小說家]][[約翰·威廉·德·佛瑞斯特|約翰·威廉·德·佛瑞斯特]] （John William De Forest）的一篇文章。然而，更廣泛地說，這種概念起源於[[美國民族主義|美國民族主義]] ，而偉大的[[英國作家|英國作家]]當時如此稱呼美國作家。

在現代用法中，這個詞往往是比喻與代表一種美國文學在一個特定的時代的文學基準寫作方式。懷有抱負的作家，尤其是學生，經常說要創作出“偉大美國小說”。從理論上講，這樣的小說也許曾經被創作出來，或不曾被創作出來。因此，“偉大美國小說”是[[柏拉圖式|柏拉圖式]]的理想，沒有任何特定的文本。
