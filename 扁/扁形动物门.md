'''扁形动物门'''（學名：{{lang|la|Platyhelminthes}}；語源：{{lang|grc|πλατύ}} ''platy'' 扁平 + {{lang|grc|ἑλμινθ-}} ''helminth-'' 蟲<ref name="Ehlers1995" />）是[[动物|动物界]]的一个门，[[無脊椎動物|無脊椎動物]]，是一类簡單的無環節[[两侧对称动物|两侧对称动物]]，有三胚层，无[[体腔|体腔]]，無呼吸系統、無循環系統，有口无肛门的动物。所以必須保持身體扁平，以使[[氧氣|氧氣]]及[[養料|養料]]能夠透過[[滲透|滲透]]來吸收。消化腔只有一個開口，同時用於進食及排泄；所以食物在其體內無法有效處理。

已记录的扁形动物约有15000种。生活於淡水、海水等潮溼處，體前端有兩個可感光的色素點。體表部分或全部分布有纖毛。

傳統的醫學文獻會將扁形動物劃分為非[[寄生蟲|寄生]]的[[渦蟲綱|渦蟲綱]]（例如：[[真渦蟲科|真渦蟲科]]的物種）和三個會寄生的物種的綱：[[絛蟲綱|絛蟲綱]]、[[吸蟲綱|吸蟲綱]]及[[單殖綱|單殖綱]]。然而，由於渦蟲綱已證實並非[[單系群|單系群]]，這種劃分方式在動物學來看已經過時。
非寄生的扁蟲都是捕食者，棲息於水中或遮蔭的陸上潮濕環境，例如：[[落葉堆|落葉堆]]。絛蟲和吸蟲的生命週期比較複雜：牠們的成熟階段會以寄生蟲的形式居住在魚類或陸上[[脊椎動物|脊椎動物]]的消化系統裡；而[[中間宿主|中間宿主]]階段會尋找可被感染的中間宿主。吸虫的卵从最终宿主体内排出，而成年绦虫会产生大量[[雌雄同体|雌雄同体]]的[[节片|节片]]，在成熟后会分离，排出宿主，再释放卵。与其他寄生的类群不同，[[单殖纲|单殖纲]]是水生生物的体外寄生虫，其幼虫在附着于合适宿主厚变态为成虫。

因为扁形动物没有体腔，它们曾被认为是最原始的两侧对称动物（有两侧对称，有头尾之分的动物）。但是，在1980年代中期以来的研究发现原来被分类为扁形动物的一个群体，[[无腔动物门|无腔动物门]]，离最初的两侧对称动物较任何其他现代类群更近。除去无腔动物后的扁形动物门是一个[[单系群|单系群]]，即是有一个共同祖先及其所有后裔组成的。扁形动物门属于[[冠轮动物|冠轮动物]]，是较复杂的两侧对称动物的三个进化支之一。這些分析顯示出已重新定義，不包含無腔動物門的扁形動物門，是由兩個單系群，Catenulida 和 Rhabitophora 所組成的 , 而絛蟲綱、吸蟲綱和單殖綱組成Rhabitophora的一個分支底下的單系群。因此，傳統上認定的渦蟲綱現在被認為是旁系群，因為其不包含從傳統渦蟲綱分支出去的寄生性物種之類群。

超过一半已知的扁形动物属于 [[寄生虫|寄生虫]], 而且某些物種會對人類以及牲畜造成很大的傷害。[[血吸虫病|血吸蟲病]]是由[[吸蟲綱|吸蟲綱]][[血吸虫|裂體屬]]的物種所造成的，是所有由寄生蟲造成的人類疾病中第二致命的，僅次於[[疟疾|瘧疾]]。囊蟲腦病變是當豬肉絛蟲的幼體(囊尾幼蟲)侵入[[中樞神經系統|中樞神經系統]]時產生, 是後天獲得之[[癫痫|癲癇]]的主因之一。這些寄生性物種在開發中國家的威脅來自於生食與未完全煮熟之食物受到歡迎，以及從高風險地區的進口。在低度開發的國家中，人們可能無法負擔用以煮熟食物之燃料的費用，再加上設計不良之供水系統以及灌溉工程，使得不良的公共衛生及農業衛生提高被感染之風險。

兩種扁形動物在菲律賓、印尼、夏威夷、新幾內亞和關島被用來控制威脅原生種蝸牛生存的外來種[[非洲大蝸牛|非洲大蝸牛]]之族群大小，並收到良好成效。但是，最近發現這些扁形動物可能自身就會威脅原生種蝸牛的生存。在西北歐地區，以蚯蚓為食的紐西蘭扁蟲(''[[Arthurdendyus_triangulatus|Arthurdendyus triangulatus]]'')的散播引起各方擔憂。

===Features common to all subgroups===
The lack of circulatory and respiratory organs limits platyhelminths to sizes and shapes that enable [[oxygen|oxygen]] to reach and [[carbon_dioxide|carbon dioxide]] to leave all parts of their bodies by simple [[diffusion|diffusion]]. Hence, many are microscopic and the large species have flat ribbon-like or leaf-like shapes. The guts of large species have many branches, allowing nutrients to diffuse to all parts of the body.<ref name="Barnes1998DiversityOfLifePlatyhelminthes" /> Respiration through the whole surface of the body makes them vulnerable to fluid loss, and restricts them to environments where [[dehydration|dehydration]] is unlikely: sea and freshwater, moist terrestrial environments such as [[leaf_litter|leaf litter]] or between grains of soil, and as [[parasite|parasite]]s within other animals.<ref name="WalkerAnderson2001PlatyhelminthesInAnderson" />

The space between the skin and gut is filled with [[mesenchyme|mesenchyme]], a [[connective_tissue|connective tissue]] made of [[cell_(biology)|cells]] and reinforced by [[collagen|collagen]] fibers that act as a type of [[skeleton|skeleton]], providing attachment points for [[muscle|muscle]]s. The mesenchyme contains all the internal organs and allows the passage of oxygen, nutrients and waste products. It consists of two main types of cell: fixed cells, some of which have fluid-filled [[vacuole|vacuole]]s; and [[stem_cell|stem cell]]s, which can transform into any other type of cell, and are used in regenerating tissues after injury or [[asexual_reproduction|asexual reproduction]].<ref name="WalkerAnderson2001PlatyhelminthesInAnderson" />

Most platyhelminths have no [[anus|anus]] and regurgitate undigested material through the mouth. However, some long species have an anus and some with complex, branched guts have more than one anus, since excretion only through the mouth would be difficult for them.<ref name="RuppertBarnes2004Platyhelminthes" /> The gut is lined with a single layer of [[endoderm|endoderm]]al cells that absorb and digest food. Some species break up and soften food first by secreting [[enzyme|enzyme]]s in the gut or [[pharynx|pharynx]] (throat).<ref name="WalkerAnderson2001PlatyhelminthesInAnderson" />

All animals need to keep the [[Concentration_(chemistry)|concentration]] of dissolved substances in their body fluids at a fairly constant level. Internal parasites and free-living marine animals live in environments with high concentrations of dissolved material, and generally let their tissues have the same level of concentration as the environment, while freshwater animals need to prevent their body fluids from becoming too dilute. Despite this difference in environments, most platyhelminths use the same system to [[osmoregulation|control the concentration]] of their body fluids. [[Flame_cell|Flame cell]]s, so called because the beating of their [[flagella|flagella]] looks like a flickering candle flame, extract from the mesenchyme 
water that contains wastes and some reusable material, and drive it into networks of tube cells which are lined with flagella and [[microvilli|microvilli]]. The tube cells' flagella drive the water towards exits called [[nephridiopore|nephridiopore]]s, while their microvilli reabsorb reusable materials and as much water as is needed to keep the body fluids at the right concentration. These combinations of flame cells and tube cells are called [[protonephridia|protonephridia]].<ref name="WalkerAnderson2001PlatyhelminthesInAnderson" /><ref name="RuppertBarnes2004Bilateria" />

In all platyhelminths, the [[nervous_system|nervous system]] is concentrated at the head end. This is least marked in the [[acoel|acoel]]s, which have [[nerve_net|nerve net]]s rather like those of [[cnidaria|cnidaria]]ns and [[ctenophore|ctenophore]]s, but densest around the head. Other platyhelminths have rings of [[Ganglion|ganglia]] in the head and main nerve trunks running along their bodies.<ref name="WalkerAnderson2001PlatyhelminthesInAnderson" /><ref name="RuppertBarnes2004Platyhelminthes" />

==主要分組==
早期分類將扁形動物分為四組，即：渦蟲綱、吸蟲綱、單殖綱及絛蟲綱。這個分類長久以來都被認為是一種人工強行分類，所以Ehlers (1985)<ref name="Ehlers 1985">{{cite book |last=Ehlers |first=U. |year=1985 |chapter=Phylogenetic relationships within the Plathelminthes |pages=pp 143–158 |title=The Origins and Relationships of Lower Invertebrates |editor1=S Conway Morris |editor2=JD George |editor3=R Gibson |editor4=HM Platt |publisher=Clarendon Press |location =Oxford |language=en }}</ref>提出一個比較符合[[支序親緣學|支序親緣學]]觀點的分類，將渦蟲綱分為12個目，然後再將吸蟲類、單殖類和絛蟲類等寄生蟲組合成一個新的[[Neodermata|Neodermata]]目。可是這個分類仍然主要只為科學文獻採用<ref name="WalkerAnderson2001PlatyhelminthesInAnderson"/>，所以以下我們仍然以傳統分類去介紹扁形動物的分類。

===渦蟲綱===
{{main |渦蟲綱}}
[[File:Pseudoceros_dimidiatus.jpg|thumb]]'']]
渦蟲綱包括有物種4500種<ref name="RuppertBarnes2004Platyhelminthes"/>均能自由遷徙，長度從{{convert|1|mm|in|abbr=on}}到{{convert|600|mm|in|abbr=on}}不等。大多數為掠食者或者是食腐動物。多居住在陰暗潮濕的地方，如落葉底下。 However, some are [[symbiosis|symbiotes]] of other animals, such as [[crustacea|crustacea]]ns, and some are [[parasite|parasite]]s. Free-living turbellarians are mostly black, brown or gray, but some larger ones are brightly colored.<ref name="WalkerAnderson2001PlatyhelminthesInAnderson" /> The [[Acoela|Acoela]] and [[Nemertodermatida|Nemertodermatida]] were traditionally regarded as turbellarians,<ref name="RuppertBarnes2004Platyhelminthes" /><ref name="JondeliusEtAl2002Nemertodermatida" /> but are now regarded as members of a separate phylum, the [[Acoelomorpha|Acoelomorpha]],<ref name="Halanych2004NewViewOfAnimalPhylogeny" /><ref name="LarssonJondelius2008PhylogenyOfCatenulida" /> or as two separate phyla.<ref name="Wallberg2007EtAlDismissalOfAcoelomorpha" /> ''[[Xenoturbella|Xenoturbella]]'', a [[genus|genus]] of very simple animals,<ref name="Westblad1949Xenoturbella" /> has also been reclassified as a separate phylum.<ref name="BourlatEtAl2003XenoturbellaPhylum" />

Some turbellarians have a simple [[pharynx|pharynx]] lined with [[Cilium|cilia]] and generally feed by using cilia to sweep food particles and small prey into their mouths, which are usually in the middle of their undersides. Most other turbellarians have a pharynx that is eversible (can be extended by being turned inside-out), and the mouths of different species can be anywhere along the underside.<ref name="WalkerAnderson2001PlatyhelminthesInAnderson" /> The freshwater species ''[[Microstomum_caudatum|Microstomum caudatum]]'' can open its mouth almost as wide as its body is long, to swallow prey about as large as itself.<ref name="RuppertBarnes2004Platyhelminthes" />

Most turbellarians have pigment-cup [[ocelli|ocelli]] ("little eyes"), one pair in most species, but two or even three pairs in some. A few large species have many eyes in clusters over the brain, mounted on tentacles, or spaced uniformly around the edge of the body. The ocelli can only distinguish the direction from which light is coming and enable the animals to avoid it. A few groups have [[statocyst|statocyst]]s, fluid-filled chambers containing a small, solid particle or, in a few groups, two. These statocysts are thought to be balance and acceleration sensors, as that is the function they perform in [[cnidaria|cnidaria]]n [[medusae|medusae]] and in [[ctenophore|ctenophore]]s. However, turbellarian statocysts have no sensory cilia, and how they sense the movements and positions of the solid particles is unknown. On the other hand, most have ciliated touch-sensor cells scattered over their bodies, especially on tentacles and around the edges. Specialized cells in pits or grooves on the head are probably smell sensors.<ref name="RuppertBarnes2004Platyhelminthes" />

[[File:Mating_Pseudobiceros_bedfordi.png|thumb]]ns are mating by [[penis_fencing|penis fencing]]. Each has two penises, the white spikes on the undersides of their heads.]]
[[Planarian|Planarian]]s, a subgroup of seriates, are famous for their ability to regenerate if divided by cuts across their bodies. Experiments show that, in fragments that do not already have a head, a new head grows most quickly on those closest to the original head. This suggests the growth of a head is controlled by a chemical whose concentration diminishes from head to tail. Many turbellarians [[cloning|clone]] themselves by transverse or longitudinal division, and others, especially acoels, reproduce by [[budding|budding]].<ref name="RuppertBarnes2004Platyhelminthes" />

The vast majority of turbellarians are [[hermaphrodite|hermaphrodite]]s (have both female and male reproductive cells), and fertilize eggs [[internal_fertilization|internally]] by [[copulation|copulation]].<ref name="RuppertBarnes2004Platyhelminthes" /> Some of the larger aquatic species mate by [[penis_fencing|penis fencing]], a duel in which each tries to impregnate the other, and the loser adopts the female role of developing the eggs.<ref>{{cite web

{{clear}}

===吸蟲綱===
{{main|吸蟲綱}}
[[File:Metagonimus_LifeCycle.gif|thumb]]'']]
[[吸蟲綱|吸蟲綱]]的學名{{lang|la|Trematoda}}源自希臘語的{{lang|grc|τρῆμα}}，意思就是一個孔洞，refers to the cavities in their [[holdfast|holdfast]]s<ref name="WalkerAnderson2001PlatyhelminthesInAnderson" /> which resemble suckers and anchor them within their hosts.<ref name="Rhode2001PlatyhelminthesInEncLifeSci">

The skin of all species is a [[syncitium|syncitium]], a layer of cells that shares a single external [[Biological_membrane|membrane]]. Trematodes are divided into two groups, Digenea and Aspidogastrea (also known as Aspodibothrea).<ref name="RuppertBarnes2004Platyhelminthes" />

====複殖亞綱====
{{main|複殖亞綱}}
These are often called flukes, as most have flat [[rhomboid|rhomboid]] shapes like that of a [[flounder|flounder]] (Old English ''flóc''). There are about 11,000 species, more than all other platyhelminthes combined, and second only to [[roundworm|roundworm]]s among parasites on [[metazoan|metazoan]]s.<ref name="RuppertBarnes2004Platyhelminthes" /> Adults usually have two holdfasts, a ring around the mouth and a larger sucker midway along what would be the underside in a free-living flatworm.<ref name="WalkerAnderson2001PlatyhelminthesInAnderson" />
Although the name "Digeneans" means "two generations", most have very complex life cycles with up to seven stages, depending on what combinations of environments the early stages encounter – most importantly whether the eggs are deposited on land or in water. The intermediate stages transfer the parasites from one host to another. The [[definitive_host|definitive host]] in which adults develop is a land vertebrate, the earliest host of juvenile stages is usually a snail that may live on land or in water, and in many cases a fish or arthropod is the second host.<ref name="RuppertBarnes2004Platyhelminthes" /> For example, the adjoining illustration shows the life cycle of the intestinal fluke ''[[metagonimus|metagonimus]]'', which hatches in the intestine of a snail; moves to a fish, where it penetrates the body and encysts in the flesh; then moves to the small intestine of a land animal that eats the fish raw; and then generates eggs that are excreted and ingested by snails, thereby completing the cycle. Schistosomes, which cause the devastating tropical disease [[bilharzia|bilharzia]], belong to this group.<ref name="SCP" />

Adults range between {{convert|0.2|mm|in|abbr=on}} and {{convert|6|mm|in|abbr=on}} in length. Individual adult digeneans are of a single sex, and in some species, slender females live in enclosed grooves that run along the bodies of the males, and partially emerge to lay eggs. In all species, the adults have complex reproductive systems and can produce between 10,000 and 100,000 times as many eggs as a free-living flatworm. In addition, the intermediate stages that live in snails reproduce asexually.<ref name="RuppertBarnes2004Platyhelminthes" />

Adults of different species infest different parts of the definitive host, for example the [[intestine|intestine]], [[lung|lung]]s, large blood vessels,<ref name="WalkerAnderson2001PlatyhelminthesInAnderson" /> and liver.<ref name="RuppertBarnes2004Platyhelminthes" /> The adults use a relatively large, muscular [[pharynx|pharynx]] to ingest cells, cell fragments, [[mucus|mucus]], body fluids or blood. In both the adults and the stages that live in snails, the external syncytium absorbs dissolved nutrients from the host. Adult digeneans can live without oxygen for long periods.<ref name="RuppertBarnes2004Platyhelminthes" />

====Aspidogastrea====
{{main|Aspidogastrea}}
Members of this small group have either a single divided sucker or a row of suckers that cover the underside.<ref name="RuppertBarnes2004Platyhelminthes" /> They infest the guts of [[teleost|bony]] or [[elasmobranch|cartilaginous]] fish and of turtles, and the body cavities of marine and freshwater [[bivalve|bivalve]]s and [[gastropod|gastropod]]s.<ref name="WalkerAnderson2001PlatyhelminthesInAnderson" /> Their eggs produce [[cilia|cilia]]ted swimming larvae, and the life cycle has one or two hosts.<ref name="RuppertBarnes2004Platyhelminthes" />

===Cercomeromorpha===
These parasites attach themselves to their hosts by means of disks that bear crescent-shaped hooks. They are divided into Monogenea and Cestoda.<ref name="RuppertBarnes2004Platyhelminthes" />

====單殖綱====

{{main|單殖綱}}
[[單殖綱|單殖綱]]，舊作[[單殖目|單殖目]]，目前包括約1100個物種，絕大多數都是[[外部寄生蟲|外部寄生蟲]]，需要特定物種作為[[中間宿主|中間宿主]]。體型細小，約2～3 cm長。這些中間宿主以[[魚類|魚類]]最為常見，但有時也可以是[[兩棲類|兩棲類]]或[[水生爬蟲類|水生]][[爬蟲類|爬蟲類]]動物。少數屬於[[內部寄生蟲|內部寄生蟲]]。單殖綱的成蟲在其後端有大型的附著器官，{{tsl|en|haptor|}}s (Greek ἅπτειν, ''haptein'', means "catch"), which have {{tsl|en|Sucker (parasitic worm anatomy)|}}, {{tsl|en|clamp (zoology)|}}, and hooks. They often have flattened bodies. In some species, the <!-- [[pharynx|pharynx]] -->[[咽|咽]] secretes enzymes to digest the host's skin, allowing the parasite to feed on blood and cellular debris. Others graze externally on mucus and flakes of the hosts' skins.

[[File:Taenia_LifeCycle.gif|thumb]]物種的生命週期。圖5顯示的是4條[[豬帶絛蟲|豬帶絛蟲]]，在其末端有盤狀倒鉤。圖6顯示的是一整條絛蟲。]]
絛蟲有扁瘦但非常長的身體。其學名
“cestode”的字根源於[[拉丁語|拉丁語]]的{{lang|la| ''cestus''}}，意思就是「帶子」。這3400個絛蟲的物種的成蟲都是內部寄生蟲。牠們沒有口部和腸臟，
and the [[syncitium|syncitial]] skin absorbs nutrients – mainly [[carbohydrate|carbohydrate]]s and [[amino_acid|amino acid]]s – from the host, and also disguises it chemically to avoid attacks by the host's [[immune_system|immune system]].<ref name="RuppertBarnes2004Platyhelminthes" /> Shortage of carbohydrates in the host's diet stunts the growth of the parasites and kills some. Their [[metabolism|metabolism]]s generally use simple but inefficient chemical processes, and they compensate by consuming large amounts of food relative to their size.<ref name="WalkerAnderson2001PlatyhelminthesInAnderson" />

In the majority of species, known as eucestodes ("true tapeworms"), the neck produces a chain of segments called proglottids by a process known as [[strobilation|strobilation]]. Hence, the most mature proglottids are furthest from the scolex. Adults of ''[[Taenia_saginata|Taenia saginata]]'', which infests humans, can form proglottid chains over {{convert|20|m|ft}} long, although {{convert|4|m|ft}} is more typical. Each proglottid has both male and female reproductive organs. If the host's gut contains two or more adults of the same cestode species, they generally fertilize each other, but proglottids of the same worm can fertilize each other and even fertilize themselves. When the eggs are fully developed, the proglottids separate and are excreted by the host. The eucestode life cycle is less complex than that of [[digenea|digenea]]ns, but varies depending on the species. For example:
*Adults of ''[[Diphyllobothrium|Diphyllobothrium]]'' infest fish, and the juveniles use [[copepod|copepod]] crustaceans as intermediate hosts. Excreted proglottids release their eggs into the water, and the eggs hatch into [[cilia|cilia]]ted, swimming larvae. If a larva is swallowed by a copepod, it sheds the cilia and the skin becomes a syncitium and the larva makes its way into the copepod's [[hemocoel|hemocoel]] (internal cavity that is the main part of the [[circulatory_system|circulatory system]]) and attached itself with three small hooks. If the copepod is eaten by a fish, the larva [[metamorphosis|metamorphoses]] into a small, unsegmented tapeworm, drills through to the gut and becomes an adult.<ref name="RuppertBarnes2004Platyhelminthes" />
*Various species of ''[[Taenia_(genus)|Taenia]]'' infest the guts of humans, cats and dogs. The juveniles use herbivores – for example pigs, cattle and rabbits – as intermediate hosts. Excreted proglottids release eggs that stick to grass leaves and hatch after being swallowed by a herbivore. The larva makes its way to the herbivore's muscles and metamorphoses into an oval worm about {{convert|10|mm|in}} long, with a scolex that is kept inside. When the definitive host eats infested and raw or undercooked meat from an intermediate host, the worm's scolex pops out and attaches itself to the gut, and the adult tapeworm develops.<ref name="RuppertBarnes2004Platyhelminthes" />

A members of the smaller group known as [[Cestodaria|Cestodaria]] have no scolex, do not produce proglottids, and have body shapes like those of diageneans. Cestodarians parasitize fish and turtles.<ref name="WalkerAnderson2001PlatyhelminthesInAnderson" />

The earliest known fossils of tapeworms have been dated to {{Ma|270}}. They were found in [[coprolite|coprolite]]s (fossilised faeces) from an [[elasmobranch|elasmobranch]].<ref name="Dentzien-Dias2013">{{cite journal | last1 = Dentzien-Dias | first1 = PC | last2 = Poinar | first2 = G Jr | last3 = de Figueiredo | first3 = AE | last4 = Pacheco | first4 = AC | last5 = Horn | first5 = BL | last6 = Schultz | first6 = CL | date = 30 January 2013 | title = Tapeworm eggs in a 270 million-year-old shark coprolite | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 8 | issue = 1| page = e55007 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0055007 | pmid=23383033 | pmc=3559381}}</ref>

===Parasitism===
[[File:Neurocysticercosis.gif|thumb]] demonstrating multiple [[Cestoda|cysticerci]] within the brain]]
[[Cestode|Cestode]]s (tapeworms) and [[digenea|digenea]]ns (flukes) cause important diseases in humans and their [[livestock|livestock]], and [[monogenea|monogenea]]ns can cause serious losses of stocks in [[fish_farm|fish farm]]s.<ref name="NorthropClewesShaw2000Parasites" /> [[Schistosomiasis|Schistosomiasis]], also known as bilharzia or snail fever, is the second-most devastating parasitic disease in tropical countries, behind [[malaria|malaria]]. The [[Carter_Center|Carter Center]] estimated 200 million people in 74 countries are infected with the disease, and half the victims live in Africa. The condition has a low [[mortality_rate|mortality rate]], but often is a [[chronic_illness|chronic illness]] that can damage internal organs. It can impair the growth and [[cognitive_development|cognitive development]] of children, and increase the risk of [[bladder_cancer|bladder cancer]] in adults. The disease is caused by several flukes of the genus ''[[Schistosoma|Schistosoma]]'', which can bore through human skin. The people most at risk are those who use infected bodies of water for recreation or [[laundry|laundry]].<ref name="SCP">{{Cite web | author= The Carter Center| title=Schistosomiasis Control Program|url=http://www.cartercenter.org/health/schistosomiasis/index.html|accessdate=2008-07-17}}</ref>

Infection of humans by the broad fish tapeworm ''[[Diphyllobothrium_latum|Diphyllobothrium latum]]'' occasionally causes [[vitamin_B12|vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]] deficiency and, in severe cases, [[megaloblastic_anemia|megaloblastic anemia]].<ref name="NorthropClewesShaw2000Parasites" />

The threat to humans in developed countries is rising as a result of social trends: the increase in [[organic_farming|organic farming]], which uses [[manure|manure]] and [[sewage_sludge|sewage sludge]] rather than artificial [[fertilizer|fertilizer]]s, and spreads parasites both directly and via the droppings of [[seagull|seagull]]s which feed on manure and sludge; the increasing popularity of raw or lightly cooked foods; imports of meat, [[seafood|seafood]] and [[salad|salad]] vegetables from high-risk areas; and, as an underlying cause, reduced awareness of parasites compared with other [[public_health|public health]] issues such as [[pollution|pollution]]. In less-developed countries, inadequate sanitation and the use of human [[feces|feces]] (night soil) as fertilizer and to enrich fish farm ponds continues to spread parasitic platyhelminths, and poorly designed water-supply and [[irrigation|irrigation]] projects have provided additional channels for their spread. People in these countries often cannot afford the cost of fuel required to cook food thoroughly enough to kill parasites. Controlling parasites that infect humans and livestock has become more difficult, as many species have become [[Drug_resistance|resistant]] to drugs that used to be effective, mainly for killing juveniles in meat.<ref name="NorthropClewesShaw2000Parasites">{{cite journal

===Pests===
There is concern about the proliferation in northwest Europe, including the British Isles, of the New Zealand [[planarian|planarian]] ''[[Arthurdendyus_triangulatus|Arthurdendyus triangulatus]]'' and the Australian flatworm ''[[Australoplana_sanguinea|Australoplana sanguinea]]'', both of which prey on earthworms.<ref>[http://www.gov.im/lib/docs/daff/informationsheetupdatedflatworms.pdf Flatworm information sheet – Isle of Man Government] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501025632/http://www.gov.im/lib/docs/daff/informationsheetupdatedflatworms.pdf |date=2013-05-01 }}</ref> ''A. triangulatus'' is thought to have reached Europe in containers of plants imported by [[botanical_garden|botanical garden]]s.<ref>{{cite journal

===Benefits===
In Hawaii, the planarian ''[[Endeavouria_septemlineata|Endeavouria septemlineata]]'' has been used to control the imported giant African [[snail|snail]] ''[[Achatina_fulica|Achatina fulica]]'', which was displacing native snails, and ''[[Platydemus_manokwari|Platydemus manokwari]]'', another planarian, has been used for the same purpose in Philippines, Indonesia, New Guinea and Guam. Although ''A. fulica'' has declined sharply in Hawaii, there are doubts about how much ''E. septemlineata'' contributed to this. However, ''P. manokwari'' is given credit for severely reducing, and in places exterminating, ''A. fulica'' – achieving much greater success than most [[biological_pest_control|biological pest control]] programs, which generally aim for a low, stable population of the pest species. The ability of planarians to take different kinds of prey and to resist starvation may account for their ability to decimate ''A. fulica''. However, these abilities have raised concerns that planarians may themselves become a serious threat to native snails.<ref>{{cite book

The experiment showed that ''G. anceps'' in particular can prey on all [[instars|instars]] of both mosquito species and maintain a steady predation rate over time. The ability for these flatworms to live in artificial containers showed the potential of placing these species in popular mosquito breeding sites, which would ideally reduce the amount of [[mosquito-borne_disease|mosquito-borne disease]]s.
