'''[https://www.24rape.com/ 私家偵探]'''，-{zh-cn:[[台湾|台湾]]称为'''[https://www.24rape.com/ 征信公司]'''、'''征信社'''; zh-hk:[[台灣|台灣]]稱為'''[https://www.24rape.com/ 徵信公司]'''、'''[https://www.24rape.com/ 徵信社]''';zh-tw:台灣以外華人地區稱為'''私家偵探'''}-，是協助查證人事物真相、收集對方資料、以及替客戶解決疑難雜症的[[機構|機構]]或个人，其涉及的業務相當廣泛，大多為委託人調查他人的某些行為或行踪，這些行為並未完全是合法進行。包括：徵信社尋人、尋址、調查[[外遇|外遇]]、調解[[婚外情|婚外情]]、調查[[員工|員工]]或[[老闆|老闆]]操守、追蹤或反跟蹤、[[監聽|監聽]]、[[讨债公司|账务追讨]]、[[捉姦|捉姦]]和證據保全、工商徵信、仿冒調查、婚前徵信、感情問題處理以及各类问题等。

== 起源 ==
-{zh-cn:[https://www.credits-search.com/ 私家侦探]; zh-hk:私家偵探;zh-tw:私家偵探}-業的存在並不僅僅是西方國家中特有的一種社會現象。

[[北歐|北歐]]、[[南美|南美]]和[[大洋洲|大洋洲]]的許多國家中也有-{zh-cn:私家侦探; zh-hk:私家偵探;zh-tw:私家偵探}-，[[亞洲|亞洲]]和[[非洲|非洲]]的一些國家或者地區中也有-{zh-cn:私家侦探; zh-hk:私家偵探;zh-tw:私家偵探}-，如[[香港|香港]]、[[臺灣|台灣]]、[[泰國|泰國]]、[[菲律賓|菲律賓]]、[[新加坡|新加坡]]、[[馬來西亞|馬來西亞]]、[[尚比亞|尚比亞]]和[[辛巴威|辛巴威]]等。

== 目的 ==
徵信業者提供的徵信服務，依照各家營業訴求而有所不同，綜觀服務範圍涵蓋以下： 工商徵信、財產徵信、商業仿冒調查、[[商標|商標]]、智慧財產權等侵權調查、個人或公司行號的信用調查、犯罪蒐證、債權追償、帳款催收。私人感情生活調查、婚前徵信、偷情劈腿蒐證、[[婚外情|婚外情]]及外遇蒐證等。提供蒐證錄音、行蹤跟監、錄影拍照、法律諮詢、婚姻調解、離婚服務、尋人查址、外遇抓姦、[[監護權|監護權]]爭取和婚姻挽回。

除了感情徵信為大宗之外，另外近年來較多人尋求的徵信服務是尋人尋物(及尋寵物)等{{Citation needed}}，藉由徵信社專業的追查及蒐證能力，尋找遺失的人事物。

==客戶來源==
客戶來自各個階層，但他們聘用私家偵探的原因却各不相同。部份人士因遇上[[婚姻|婚姻]]等問題，認為私家偵探能忠實地為委託人查到真相，因此他們求助，並且有可能以此為通姦證據申請[[離婚|離婚]]，於通姦不合法的國家裡，更可以作為控告[[配偶|配偶]]通姦或[[第三者_(愛情)|第三者]]妨害家庭的憑證。部份私家偵探社亦兼營[[討債公司|討債公司]]。台灣通姦罪屬於刑法239條，處一年以下有期徒刑，屬於告訴乃論。
除了最大宗的婚姻問題外，徵信社在[[尋人|尋人]]這部分的業務也是其獨特之處。在目前台灣社會，除了部分[[戶政事務所|戶政事務所]]、[[警察|警察]]單位外，就只有徵信社是以民營公司的立場收取酬勞的。
徵信社使用的手段有時候會介於法律邊緣，是否順利找到目標、還是拿錢不辦事等，視該徵信社是否正派。但不可諱言地，
在很多情況下，要解決問題除了請徵信社外，似乎沒有更好的選擇（像是債務尋人）。這也造成台灣民眾有相關需求、但又擔心徵信社拿錢不辦事的矛盾心理。
在台灣許多的徵信工會號稱中立，但實際情況，背後的管理者仍為各大徵信社。

==各地情況==
===香港===
在[[香港|香港]]，私家偵探這個行業是沒有任何[[監管|監管]]的，除了一般的領取公司註冊及商業登記外，許多私家偵探社自稱[[政府|政府]]註冊，其實只是辦理了一般的[[香港|香港]]成立的[[公司註冊|公司註冊]]和[[商業登記|商業登記]]手續的公司，可以在香港[[營商|營商]]，並非己領有任何[[牌照|牌照]]。
===台灣===
在[[台灣|台灣]]，-{zh-cn:-私家侦探; zh-hk:私家偵探; zh-tw:私家偵探}-就是「-{zh-cn:-征信社; zh-hk:徵信社; zh-tw:[https://www.credits-search.com/ 徵信社]}-」，但須依照[[中華民國|中華民國]]法律以「-{zh-cn:-征信社; zh-hk:徵信社; zh-tw:徵信社}-」，「[https://www.credits-search.com/ 徵信公司]」的名稱註冊。

而現今台灣與大陸已經三通，更多徵信業者打著幫台灣原配到大陸抓台商二奶的噱頭，與原配週休二日直奔上海北京等地抓姦，三通開放亦替台灣徵信業者開創一筆生意。但可能有觸犯隱私權的疑慮。

另外，在部份國家私家偵探是需要領執照的。在中国，私家侦探都是非法執業的。

==虛構作品中的私家偵探==
不少文學作品、電視連續劇及漫畫中的私家偵探，形象都是正直無私、有[[職業道德|職業道德]]及屢破奇案，有操守、有正義感及觸角敏銳，例如[[柯南道爾|柯南道爾]]的作品《[[福爾摩斯|福爾摩斯]]探案》。[[日本|日本]]漫畫[[柯南|柯南]]中的偵探社。
電影作品方面，跟徵信社有關的則有台灣電影傻瓜向前衝、洋片[[假會[https:/www.credits-search.com/_徵信社|假會[https://www.credits-search.com/ 徵信社]]]等作品。

在伦敦, 查尔斯·弗雷德里克·菲尔德<sup><small>Charles Frederick Field</small></sup> 于1852年从警署退休后，在当地设立了一个私家侦探所，菲尔德成了查尔斯·狄更斯<sup><small>Charles Dickens</small></sup>,的朋友，查尔斯·狄更斯写了一些关于菲尔德的文章。

1862年，菲尔德的一名雇员，匈牙利人伊格内修斯·保罗·波拉基<sup><small>Ignatius Paul Pollaky</small></sup>离开了他，成立了一个与之竞争的机构。虽然如今记载很少，但波拉基在当时的名气让他在19世纪70年代的各种书籍中被提及并因其在1881年的喜剧歌剧“耐心 <sup><small>Patience</small></sup>”中的“敏锐洞察力<sup><small>keen penetration</small></sup>”而被称为不朽的“帕丁顿<sup><small>Paddington</small></sup>”波拉基。

In the United States, [[Allan_Pinkerton|Allan Pinkerton]] established the [[Pinkerton_National_Detective_Agency|Pinkerton National Detective Agency]] – a private detective agency – in 1850. Pinkerton became famous when he foiled [[Baltimore_Plot|a plot]] to [[assassinate|assassinate]] then President-elect [[Abraham_Lincoln|Abraham Lincoln]] in 1861. Pinkerton's agents performed services which ranged from undercover investigations and detection of crimes, to plant protection and armed security. It is sometimes claimed,{{by whom|date=May 2015}} probably with exaggeration, that at the height of its existence, the Pinkerton National Detective Agency employed more agents than the [[United_States_Army|United States Army]].<ref name="main" /> Allan Pinkerton hired [[Kate_Warne|Kate Warne]] in 1856 as a private detective, making her the first female private detective in America.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pimall.com/nais/pivintage/katewarne.html |title=Kate Warne America's First female Private-Eye |publisher=Pimall.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-14 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120710224522/http://www.pimall.com/nais/pivintage/katewarne.html |archivedate=2012-07-10 |df= }}</ref>

During the union unrest in the US in the late 19th century, companies sometimes hired operatives and armed guards from the Pinkertons. In the aftermath of the [[Homestead_Strike|Homestead Riot]] of 1892, several states passed so-called "anti-Pinkerton" laws restricting the importation of private security guards during union strikes. The federal [[Anti-Pinkerton_Act|Anti-Pinkerton Act]] of 1893 continues to prohibit an "individual employed by the Pinkerton Detective Agency, or similar organization" from being employed by "the Government of the United States or the government of the District of Columbia."<ref name="main" /><ref>
5 U.S. Code 3108; Public Law 89-554, 80 Stat. 416 (1966); ch. 208 (5th par. under "Public Buildings"), 27 Stat. 591 (1893). The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in ''U.S. ex rel. Weinberger'' v. ''Equifax'', 557 F.2d 456 (5th Cir. 1977), ''cert. denied'', 434 U.S. 1035 (1978), held that "The purpose of the Act and the legislative history reveal that an organization was 'similar' to the Pinkerton Detective Agency only if it offered for hire mercenary, quasi-military forces as strikebreakers and armed guards. It had the secondary effect of deterring any other organization from providing such services lest it be branded a 'similar organization.'" 557 F.2d at 462; ''see also'' {{cite web

Pinkerton agents were also hired to track western outlaws [[Jesse_James|Jesse James]], the [[Reno_Gang|Reno brothers]], and the [[Butch_Cassidy's_Wild_Bunch|Wild Bunch]], including [[Butch_Cassidy|Butch Cassidy]] and the [[Sundance_Kid|Sundance Kid]].

== Employment ==
Many private detectives/investigators with special academic and practical experience also work with defense [[lawyer|attorney]]s on [[capital_punishment|capital punishment]] and other [[criminal_defense|criminal defense]] cases. Many others are [[insurance_investigator|insurance investigator]]s who investigate suspicious claims. Before the advent of [[no-fault_divorce|no-fault divorce]], many private investigators sought evidence of adultery or other conduct within marriage to establish grounds for a divorce. Despite the lack of legal necessity for such evidence in many jurisdictions, according to press reports, collecting evidence of spouses' and partners' adultery or other "bad behaviour" is still one of their most profitable undertakings, as the stakes being fought over now are child custody, alimony, or marital property disputes.<ref name="main">{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/protective-service/private-detectives-and-investigators.htm|title=Private Detectives and Investigators|publisher=United States Department of Labor, Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2010-2011 Edition|year=2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702131834/http://www.bls.gov/ooh/protective-service/private-detectives-and-investigators.htm|archivedate=2015-07-02|df=}}</ref>

Private investigators can also perform [[due_diligence|due diligence]] for an investor considering investing with an investment group, fund manager, or other high-risk business or investment venture. This could help the prospective investor avoid being the victim of a fraud or [[Ponzi_scheme|Ponzi scheme]]. A licensed and experienced investigator could reveal the investment is risky and/or the investor has a suspicious background. This is called investigative due diligence, and is becoming more prevalent in the 21st century with the public reports of large-scale Ponzi schemes and fraudulent investment vehicles such as Madoff, Stanford, Petters, Rothstein, and the hundreds of others reported by the [[U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission|Securities and Exchange Commission]] along with other law enforcement agencies.

==Responsibilities==
Private investigators also engage in a variety of work not often associated with the industry in the mind of the public. For example, many are involved in [[service_of_process|process serving]], the personal delivery of summons, [[subpoena|subpoena]]s, and other legal documents to parties in a legal case. The tracing of absconding debtors can also form a large part of a PI's work load. Many agencies specialize in a particular field of expertise. For example, some PI agencies deal only in tracing. A handful of firms specialize in [[technical_surveillance_counter-measures|technical surveillance counter-measures]], sometimes called electronic counter measures, which is the locating and dealing with unwanted forms of electronic surveillance (for example, a bugged boardroom for industrial espionage purposes). This niche service is typically conducted by those with backgrounds in intelligence/counterintelligence, executive protection, and a small number from law enforcement entities whose duties included the covert installation of eavesdropping devices as a tool in organized crime, terrorism and narco-trafficking investigations. <!-- not encyclopedic The best known of these firms in the U.S. include Granite Island Group, Confidential Research & Investigations LLC, Murray & Associates,SLC Security Services LLC and TSCM/Special Operations Group Inc. --> Other PIs, also known as corporate investigators, specialize in corporate matters, including antifraud work, loss prevention, internal investigations of employee misconduct (such as [[Equal_Employment_Opportunity_Commission|Equal Employment Opportunities]] violations and sexual harassment), the protection of [[intellectual_property|intellectual property]] and [[trade_secret|trade secret]]s, antipiracy, [[copyright_infringement|copyright infringement]] investigations, due diligence investigations, malware and cyber criminal activity, and [[computer_forensics|computer forensics]] work. Some PIs act as professional witnesses where they observe situations with a view to reporting the actions or lack of them to a court or to gather evidence in [[antisocial_behavior|antisocial behavior]].<ref name="main" />

==Undercover investigator==
An undercover investigator, undercover detective, or undercover agent is a person who conducts investigations of suspected or confirmed criminal activity while impersonating a disinterested third party. Undercover investigators often infiltrate a suspected insurgent group, posing as a person interested in purchasing illegal goods or services with the ultimate aim of obtaining information about their assigned target.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wisegeekedu.com/what-does-an-undercover-detective-do.htm |title=What does an Undercover Detective do? (with pictures) |publisher=Wisegeekedu.com |date=2015-06-26 |accessdate=2015-07-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150709124759/http://www.wisegeekedu.com/what-does-an-undercover-detective-do.htm |archivedate=2015-07-09 |df= }}</ref>

Many undercover investigators carry [[hidden_camera|hidden camera]]s and recorders strapped to their bodies to help them document their investigations. The period of the investigation could last for several months, or in some extreme cases, years. Due to the dangerous nature of the job, their real identities are kept secret throughout their active careers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/om/pdf/2009/pr442-09_report.pdf |format=PDF |title=Gun Show : Undercover : Report on Illegal Sales at Gun Shows |publisher=Nyc.gov |accessdate=2015-07-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015122657/http://www.nyc.gov/html/om/pdf/2009/pr442-09_report.pdf |archivedate=2015-10-15 |df= }}</ref>
Economic investigations, business intelligence and information on competitors, security advice, special security services information, criminal investigation, investigations background, and profile polygraph tests are all typical examples of such a role.

Undercover investigators are often misinterpreted as being similar to a police officer or deputy, however, they are quite the opposite. As opposed to a police officer, a private or undercover detective is trained in keeping a low profile, and are under no requirement to wear a uniform or a badge. Police are trained to be direct in their approach unless using a disguised vehicle.

Certain types of undercover investigators, depending on their employer, will investigate allegations of abuse of workman's compensation. Those claiming to be injured are often investigated and recorded with a hidden camera/recorder. This is then presented in court or to the client who paid for the investigation.

== Across the world ==
Many jurisdictions require PIs to be licensed. Depending on local laws, they may or may not carry a firearm, some are former law enforcement agents (including former police officers), some are former spies, some are former military, some used to work for a private military company, and some are former bodyguards and security guards. While PIs may investigate criminal matters, most do not have police authority, and as such, they are only limited to the powers of [[citizen's_arrest|citizen's arrest]] and detention that any other citizen has. They are expected to keep detailed notes and to be prepared to testify in court regarding any of their observations on behalf of their clients. Great care is required to remain within the scope of the law, otherwise the investigator may face criminal charges. Irregular hours may also be required when performing surveillance work.<ref name="main" />

=== Australia===
{{Unreferenced Section|date=November 2016}}
Private investigators in Australia must be licensed by the licensing authority relevant to the state where they are located. This applies to all states except the Australian Capital Territory. Companies offering investigation services must also hold a business licence and all their operatives must hold individual licences. Generally, the licences are administered and regulated by the state police; however, in some states, this can also be managed by other government agencies.

To become registered in New South Wales requires a CAPI licence, which can be applied for through the NSW Police Force website.
The Australian Capital Territory does not require PIs to be licensed, although they are still bound by legislation. PIs working in the ACT cannot enter the NSW area without a CAPI license, else they will be in breach of the law.
In Queensland, a private investigator need to be licensed under the [[Queensland_Government|Queensland Government]] and apply for a private investigator licence<ref>{{cite web |last1=Queensland; |first1=The State of |title=Apply for a private investigator licence {{!}} Security (manpower) licence |url=https://www.qld.gov.au/law/laws-regulated-industries-and-accountability/queensland-laws-and-regulations/regulated-industries-and-licensing/regulated-industries-licensing-and-legislation/security-industry-regulation/get-a-security-licence/security-manpower-licence/apply-for-a-private-investigator-licence |website=www.qld.gov.au |language=en}}</ref> by completing an application for a security provider licence. Applicant will need to have a criminal history check and submit fingerprint.

===UK===
In 2001, the government passed the licensing of private investigators and private investigation firms in the UK over to the [[Security_Industry_Authority|Security Industry Authority]] (SIA), which acted as the regulatory body from then on. However, due to the cutbacks of this agency, licensing of private investigators in the UK was halted indefinitely. At present, no government-backed authorities in the UK license private investigators.

The SIA have announced that PIs in the UK were to become licensed for the first time from May 2015, but this is only the scheduled date for the issue to be discussed in parliament. In December 2014, Corporate Livewire produced an article written by a UK private investigator at BAR Investigations, addressing the issues surrounding private investigation in the UK.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sia.homeoffice.gov.uk/Pages/licensing-private-investigations.aspx |title=Regulation of Private Investigations |publisher=Sia.homeoffice.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-07-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150728191851/http://www.sia.homeoffice.gov.uk/Pages/licensing-private-investigations.aspx |archivedate=2015-07-28 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.corporatelivewire.com/top-story.html?id=private-investigators-in-the-uk-how-the-role-is-changing |title=Top Stories |publisher=Corporate LiveWire |date=2014-12-17 |accessdate=2015-07-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150921033137/http://www.corporatelivewire.com/top-story.html?id=private-investigators-in-the-uk-how-the-role-is-changing |archivedate=2015-09-21 |df= }}</ref>

===United States===
Private investigators in the United States may or may not be licensed or registered by a government licensing authority or state police of the state where they are located. Licensing varies from state to state and can range from: a) no state license required; b) city or state business license required (such as in five states ([[Idaho|Idaho]], [[Alaska|Alaska]], [[Mississippi|Mississippi]], [[South_Dakota|South Dakota]], and [[Wyoming|Wyoming]]); c) to needing several years of experience and licensing-related training classes and testing (as is the case with [[Virginia|Virginia]] and [[California|California]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pursuitmag.com/resources/investigator-licensing/|title=Private Investigator Licensing Requirements|author=|date=|website=pursuitmag.com|accessdate=1 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171008213330/http://pursuitmag.com/resources/investigator-licensing/|archivedate=8 October 2017|df=}}</ref> In many states, companies offering investigation services must hold an agency license, and all of their investigators or detectives must hold individual licenses or registrations;{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} furthermore, certain states such as [[Washington_(state)|Washington]] have separate classes of licensing for roles such as trainers of private investigators.<ref>{{cite web|title=Private Investigators: Licensing and Legal Issues in the US|url=https://www.nig.co.uk/private-investigators-licensing-and-legal-issues-in-the-usa/|publisher=Nationwide Investigations Group|accessdate=27 November 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161127085113/https://www.nig.co.uk/private-investigators-licensing-and-legal-issues-in-the-usa/|archivedate=27 November 2016|df=}}</ref> A few reciprocity agreements allow a detective working in one state to continue work in another for a limited time without getting a separate license, but not all states participate in these agreements.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://privateinvestigatoredu.org/license-requirements/|title=Private Investigator License Requirements|publisher=privateinvestigatoredu.org|accessdate=2015-12-11|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222161742/http://privateinvestigatoredu.org/license-requirements/|archivedate=2015-12-22|df=}}</ref>

In 1877, [[Colorado|Colorado]] became the first state in the union to institute licensing requirements for private investigators. Because of the vague definition of term 'private investigator', the law was declared unconstitutional in 1977, but reinstated on a voluntary basis in July 2012 and mandatory in June 2015.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.pinow.com/articles/1260/colorado-pi-licensing|title=The Significance of Colorado PI Licensing|work=PInow.com - Find Local Investigators|access-date=2018-08-30|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://privateinvestigatoredu.org/colorado/|title=How to Become a Private Investigator in Colorado - CO {{!}} License for PI Jobs and Training School Requirements|website=privateinvestigatoredu.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-30}}</ref>

As per the [[Ontario|Ontario]] text of the [https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/05p3{{Dead link|date=January 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Private Security and Investigative Services Act of 2005], private investigators are forbidden from referring to themselves as [[detective|detective]] or [[private_detective|private detective]]. In order to become a licensed private investigator, you must be 18 years of age or older in [[Ontario|Ontario]] (in other [[Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada|Provinces and territories of Canada]] the eligible age to work may be higher); have a clean criminal record or obtain a waiver; and submit a correctly completed application for a license.
