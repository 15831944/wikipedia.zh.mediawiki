'''私家路'''（Private road），是一條行人或者行車通道、[[街道|街道]]，由私人物業擁有。它相對於[[政府|政府]]官方所擁有及管理的公路或街道。私家路業主可能會發出一些附例，限制私家路的使用者（行人或者駕車人士）的進入權及使用權，包括泊車權及收費率。<!---
A private road is a road owned and maintained by a private individual, organization, or company rather than by a government. Consequently, unauthorized use of the road may be considered trespassing, and some of the usual rules of the road may not apply. The most common type of private road is a residential road maintained by a homeowners association, co-op, or other group of individual homeowners. There are also networks of private highways in Italy and other nations. Such highways typically are toll roads whose upkeep is paid for with user fees.

England and Wales are thought to have about 40,000 private roads.  They are not the responsibility of the local authority, so have to be maintained by residents.  Public use over time may nonetheless have created public rights of way;  though by Part 6 of the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006, in force from 2 May 2006, many public rights of way for motor vehicles in private roads have now been extinguished.
