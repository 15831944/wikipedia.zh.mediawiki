'''亨利·哈维洛克·艾利斯'''（{{lang-en|Henry Havelock Ellis}}，{{bd|1859年|2月2日|1939年|7月8日}}）是一位[[英国|英国]]医生、[[性心理学|性心理学]]家和研究[[人类性行为|人类性行为]]的社会改革者。

亨利·哈维洛克·艾利斯的父亲是爱德华·佩平·艾利斯，母亲是苏珊娜·玛丽·惠特利,出生在伦敦南面的小城[[克罗伊登|克罗伊登]]。<!-- His father was a sea captain, his mother, the daughter of a sea captain, and many other relatives lived on or near the sea. At seven years of age his father took him on one of his voyages, during which he called at [[Sydney|Sydney]], [[Callao|Callao]] and [[Antwerp|Antwerp]]. After his return Ellis went to a fairly good school, the French and German College near [[Wimbledon,_London|Wimbledon]], and afterward attended a school in [[Mitcham|Mitcham]]. --> 

<!-- ==Teaching==
In April 1875 he left London on his father's ship for [[Australia|Australia]], and soon after his arrival in Sydney obtained a position as a master at a private school. 
It was discovered that he had had no training for this position and so he became a tutor for a family living a few miles from Carcoar. He spent a happy year there, doing a lot of reading, and then obtained a position as a master at a grammar school in Grafton. The headmaster had died and Ellis carried on the school for that year, but was too young and inexperienced to do so successfully. 

At the end of the year, he returned to Sydney and, after three months training, was given charge of two government part-time elementary schools, one at Sparkes Creek and the other at Junction Creek. He lived happily and healthily at the school house on Sparkes Creek for a year - the most eventful year of his life as he was afterwards to call it: "In Australia I gained health of body; I attained peace of soul; my life task was revealed to me; I was able to decide on a professional vocation; I became an artist in literature . . . these five points covered the whole activity of my life in the world. Some of them I should doubtless have reached without the aid of the Australian environment, scarcely all, and most of them I could never have achieved so completely if chance had not cast me into the solitude of the Liverpool Range." -->


<!-- ==Medicine==
Ellis returned to England in April 1879. He had decided to take up the study of sex and felt his best step must be to qualify as a medical man. He studied medicine at [[St_Thomas'_Hospital_Medical_School|St Thomas' Hospital]], although he never had a regular medical practice; he joined [[The_Fellowship_of_the_New_Life|The Fellowship of the New Life]] in [[1883|1883]], meeting other social reformers [[Edward_Carpenter|Edward Carpenter]] and [[George_Bernard_Shaw|George Bernard Shaw]]. --> 

<!-- ==Marriage==
In November, 1891 at the age of 32, and still a virgin, Ellis married the English writer and proponent of women's rights, [[Edith_Ellis|Edith Lees]] (none of his four sisters ever married). From the beginning, their marriage was unconventional (Edith Ellis was openly lesbian), and at the end of the honeymoon, Ellis went back to his bachelor rooms in Paddington, while she lived at Fellowship House. Their "open marriage" was the central subject in Ellis's autobiography, ''My Life''. --> 艾利斯曾在其[[自傳|自傳]]《我的一生》(''My Life'')中寫到，他的朋友对于他是性学专家这件事觉得很可笑，因为他长期受到[[阳痿|阳痿]]的困扰。直到60岁时，他才发现他可以在看到女人小便时[[勃起|勃起]]。<!-- ==Sex==
According to Ellis in ''My Life'', his friends were much amused at his being considered an expert on sex considering the fact that he suffered from impotence until the age of 60, when he discovered that he was able to become aroused by the sight of a woman urinating.  Ellis named the interest in urination "Undinism" but it is now more commonly called [[Urolagnia|Urolagnia]].

His  ''Sexual Inversion'', the first English medical text book on [[homosexuality|homosexuality]], co-authored with [[John_Addington_Symonds|John Addington Symonds]], described the sexual relations of homosexual men and boys, something that Ellis did not consider to be a disease, immoral, or a crime. The work assumes that same-sex love transcends age as well as gender taboos, as seven of the twenty one examples are of intergenerational relationships. A bookseller was prosecuted in [[1897|1897]] for stocking it. Althought the term itself is attributed to Ellis, he writes in 1897, “‘Homosexual’ is a barbarously hybrid word, and I claim no responsibility for it.” [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=homosexual] Other psychologically important concepts developed by Ellis include [[autoerotism|autoerotism]] and [[narcissism|narcissism]], both of which were later taken on by [[Sigmund_Freud|Sigmund Freud]]. --> <!-- This quote needs a source--MikeX
The sexologist and writer Havelock Ellis "looked like a tripartite cross between Tolstoy, Rasputin, and Bernard Shaw; was one of the many semi-pagan ideological nudists that England produced at 19世纪末; and never achieved full sexual arousal until his second wife urinated on him in his late middle age."

{{cquote|"Eventually, it seems evident, a general system, whether private or public, whereby all personal facts, biological and mental, normal and morbid, are duly and systematically registered, must become inevitable if we are to have a real guide as to those persons who are most fit, or most unfit to carry on the race."}} -->
