'''併合'''（incorporation）為[[語言學|語言學]]之[[語法|語法]]類別上的一種現象，諸如動詞與其[[賓語|賓語]]（賓語併合）或[[副詞|副詞]]修飾語所形成的[[合成词|合成词]]；同時保留其原始的[[语法学|語法]]功能。其中包含名詞修飾動詞，併縮小其詞義涵蓋範圍，而不是引用特定的語詞實體來進行此類功能。而併合與[[黏著法構詞|黏著法構詞]](agglutination)有基本上的不同；併合主要以[[及物性|及物性]](transitivity)與[[配價|配價]](verb valency)構成為主；而黏著法構詞可以是數名詞或名詞形容詞等而合成一單詞(合成詞)，或者及物性及配價所構成亦可。

併合是[[多式综合语|多式综合语]]的核心，例如在北美、西伯利亞，以及北澳大利亞等之語言裡都可以發現此類語法現象。 然而，[[多式综合语|多式綜合功能]]並不一定意味著有併合的功能（Mithun 2009）；而且這些併合表現的語言也不意味著該語言有多式綜合的功能。

==併合範例==
===英語===
{{seealso|印欧语系}}
<!--Although not used regularly, [[English_language|English]] shows some instrument incorporation, as in ''breastfeed'', and [[direct_object|direct object]] incorporation, as in ''babysit''. Etymologically, such verbs in English are usually (always)[[back-formation|back-formation]]s: the verbs ''breastfeed'' and ''babysit'' are formed from the adjective ''breast-fed'' and the noun ''babysitter'' respectively. Incorporation and plain [[Compound_(linguistics)|compounding]] may be fuzzy categories: consider ''backstabbing'', ''name-calling'', ''axe murder''.

The following example from [[Oneida_language|Oneida]] ([[Iroquoian|Iroquoian]]) illustrates noun incorporation.

{|border="0"

| colspan="10"|waʼkhninú: ne kanaktaʼ
|-
| waʼ-

| buy-
| PUNC
| 
| ne 
| 
| PREF-
| bed-
| SUF
|-
| colspan="10"|'I bought a bed.'
|}

In this example, the verbal root ''hninu'' appears with its usual verbal morphology: a factive marker (FACT), which very roughly translates as past tense, although this is not quite accurate; an agreement marker (1.SG), which tells us that the verb agrees with 1st person singular (the speaker); and an aspect marker, punctual (PUNC), which tells us that this is a completed event. The direct object ''ne kanaktaʼ'' follows the verb. The function of the particle ''ne'' is unclear. Note that the word for bed consists of a root ''nakt'' plus a prefix and a suffix. The notion of the root is important here, but the properties of the prefix and suffix do not matter for this discussion.

The following sentence means the same as above, but noun incorporation has taken place.

{|border="0"  
|-
| colspan="6"|waʼkenaktahninú:

| FACT-
| 1.SG-
| bed-
| EPEN-
| buy-
| PUNC
|-
| colspan="6"|'I bought a bed.'
|}

In this example, the root for bed ''nakt'' has ''incorporated'' into the verbal construction and appears before the verbal root. Two other incidental changes are noticed here. First, the agreement marker in the first example is ''k'' and in the second example is ''ke''. These are two phonologically-conditioned allomorphs. In other words, the choice between using ''k'' and ''ke'' is based on the other sounds in the word (and has nothing to do with noun incorporation). Also, there is an [[epenthetic|epenthetic]] vowel ''a'' between the nominal and verbal roots. This vowel is inserted to break up an illegal consonant cluster (and also has nothing to do with noun incorporation).

The next example, from [[Panare_language|Panare]], illustrates the cross-linguistically common phenomenon that the incorporated form of a noun may be significantly different from its unincorporated form.  The first sentence contains the incorporated form ''u<nowiki>'</nowiki>'' of "head", and the second its unincorporated form ''ipu'':

[[Chukchi_language|Chukchi]], a [[Paleosiberian_language|Paleosiberian language]] spoken in North Eastern Siberia, provides a wealth of examples of noun incorporation. The phrase ''təpelarkən qoraŋə'' means "I'm leaving the reindeer" and has two words (the verb in the first person singular, and the noun). The same idea can be expressed with the single word ''təqorapelarkən'', in which the noun root ''qora-'' "reindeer" is incorporated into the verb word.

[[Mohawk_language|Mohawk]], an [[Iroquoian_languages|Iroquoian language]], makes heavy use of incorporation, as in: ''watia'tawi'tsherí:io'' "it is a good shirt", where the noun [[root_(linguistics)|root]] ''atia'tawi'' "upper body garment" is present inside the verb.

[[Cheyenne_language|Cheyenne]], an [[Algonquian_languages|Algonquian language]] of the plains, also uses noun incorporation on a regular basis. Consider ''nátahpe'emaheona'', meaning "I have a big house", which contains the noun morpheme ''maheo'' "house".

===中文===
{{seealso|汉藏语系}}
<!--
[[Standard_Chinese|Chinese]] makes extensive use of ''verb-object compounds'', which are compounds composed of two constituents having the syntactic relation of verb and its direct object.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Li|first1=Charles N.|last2=Thompson|first2=Sandra A.|title=Mandarin Chinese: A Functional Reference Grammar|date=1989|publisher=University of California Press|pages=73}}</ref> For example, the verb ''shuì-jiào'' 睡觉 'sleep (VO)' is composed of the verb ''shuì'' 睡 'sleep (V)' and the bound morpheme object ''jiào'' 觉 'sleep (N)'. Aspect markers (e.g. ''le'' 了 PERFECTIVE), classifier phrases (e.g. ''sān ge zhōngtóu'' THREE + CL + hours), and other elements may separate the two constituents of this compounds, though different verb-object compounds vary in degree of separability.
-->

==名詞併合的語義==<!--
In many cases, a phrase with an incorporated noun carries a different meaning with respect to the equivalent phrase where the noun is not incorporated into the verb. The difference seems to hang around the generality and definiteness of the statement. The incorporated phrase is usually generic and indefinite, while the non-incorporated one is more specific.

In [[Yucatec_Maya_language|Yucatec Maya]], for example, the phrase "I chopped a tree", when the word for "tree" is incorporated, changes its meaning to "I chopped wood". In [[Lahu_language|Lahu]] (a [[Tibeto-Burman_languages|Tibeto-Burman language]]), the definite phrase "I drink the liquor" becomes the more general "I drink liquor" when "liquor" is incorporated. The [[Japanese_language|Japanese]] phrase 目を覚ます ''me o samasu'' means "to wake up" or literally ''to wake (one's) eyes''. But when the direct object is incorporated into the nominal form of the verb, the resulting noun 目覚まし ''mezamashi'' literally means "waking up", as in 目覚まし時計　''mezamashidokei'' meaning "alarm clock."

This tendency is not a rule. There are languages where noun incorporation does not produce a meaning change (though it may cause a change in [[syntax|syntax]] — as explained below).

==名詞併合句法==
Noun incorporation usually deletes one of the [[verb_argument|arguments]] of the verb, and in some languages this is shown explicitly. That is, if the verb is transitive, the verb word with an incorporated direct object becomes formally intransitive and marked as such. In other languages this change does not take place, or at least it is not shown by explicit morphology.

In [[Lakota_language|Lakhota]], a [[Siouan_languages|Siouan language]] of the plains, for example, the phrase "the man is chopping wood" can be expressed either as a transitive ''wičháša kiŋ čháŋ kiŋ kaksáhe'' ("man the wood the chopping") or as an intransitive ''wičháša kiŋ čhaŋkáksahe'' ("man the wood-chopping") in which the independent nominal ''čháŋ'', "wood," becomes a root incorporated into the verb: "wood-chopping."

The noun may not be deleted after all.  In the [[Oneida_language|Oneida language]] (an [[Iroquoian_language|Iroquoian language]] spoken in Southern Ontario and Wisconsin), one finds '''classifier noun incorporation''', in which a generic noun acting as a direct object can be incorporated into a verb, but a more specific direct object is left in place.  In a rough translation, one would say for example "I animal-bought this pig", where "animal" is the generic incorporated noun.  Note that this "classifier" is not an actual [[Classifier_(linguistics)|classifier]] (i.e. a class agreement morpheme) but a common noun.

==歷時觀點的併合==
<!--
As proposed by Mithun (1984), one of the major origins of incorporation is  coalescence between noun and verb. Another proposed origin is the [[denominal_verb|denominal]] derivation of a nominal compound containing a noun root and a verb root (Jacques 2012).

In 1985, Mithun also introduced a four type system to define the functionality and progression of noun incorporation in a language. The first and simplest type, known as lexical compounding, involves a verb incorporating a nominal argument. The resulting compound usually describes a noteworthy or recurring activity. The second type uses the same process to manipulate case roles, incorporating the argument into the verb to allow for a new argument to take its place. Type III uses noun incorporation to background old or established information. A speaker might explicitly mention an entity once, for example, and thereafter refer to it using an incorporated verbal compound. The fourth and final type proposed by Mithun involves the development of a set of classificatory compounds, in which verbs are paired with generic nouns to describe properties of an entity, rather than the entity itself.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mithun|first=Marianne|date=1985|title=Diachronic morphologization: The circumstances surrounding the birth, growth and decline of noun incorporation|url=|journal=Papers from the Sixth International Conference on Historical Linguistics.|series=Current Issues in Linguistic Theory 6|publisher=John Benjamins-Adam Mickiewicz University|volume=|pages=380}}</ref> This type was previously mentioned as a feature of the [[Oneida_language|Oneida language]].

According to Mithun, languages exhibiting any of these types always display all of the lower types as well. This seems to imply a pattern of progression, as Mithun describes in her 1984 paper on the evolution of noun incorporation.

Incorporation can in its turn change into other constructions, such as denominal derivation, applicative, directional affixes (Mattisen 2006, Mithun 2009)
