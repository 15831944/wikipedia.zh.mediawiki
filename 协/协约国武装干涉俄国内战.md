{{Campaignbox 俄國內戰}}

'''协约国武装干涉俄国内战'''（'''[[俄语|俄语]]：{{lang|ru|Интервенция союзников в Россию}}'''）是指在1918年到1920年期间，[[不列颠帝国|英國]]、[[法兰西第三共和国|法國]]、[[加拿大|加拿大]]、[[美利坚合众國|美国]]、[[大日本帝国|日本]]、[[中华民国|中国]]和其他一些[[第一次世界大战|第一次世界大战]]中的[[协约国|协约国]]，对'''[[俄國內戰|俄國內戰]]'''进行的武装干涉。  
<!-- Rapidly changing circumstances in the late stages of World War I caused [[协约国|协约国]] to launch separate campaigns in [[North_Russia_Campaign|North Russia]] and [[Allied_Intervention_in_Siberia|Siberia]]. Each of these Allied campaigns would ultimately fail to achieve their objectives and the troops were withdrawn. -->  

在协约国武装干涉期间，外国军队的军事存在被[[布尔什维克|布尔什维克]]有效地用于爱国宣传，影响了俄国人民，最终赢得了内战的胜利。

== 协约国干涉的动机 ==
1917年3月发生了许多改变[[第一次世界大战|第一次世界大战]]进程的事件。随着[[俄罗斯帝国|俄罗斯帝国]][[罗曼诺夫王朝|罗曼诺夫王朝]]皇帝[[尼古拉二世|尼古拉二世]]的退位和[[俄罗斯临时政府|俄罗斯临时政府]]的成立，美国总统[[伍德罗·威尔逊|伍德罗·威尔逊]]對加入[[协约国|协约国]]一方参战的最后保留不再存在。因此美国参战，反对新成立的[[蘇俄|蘇俄]]政府，而[[亚历山大·克伦斯基|亚历山大·克伦斯基]]领导的俄国临时政府保证继续在东部战线与[[德意志帝国|德意志帝国]]战斗。为了使俄国临时政府能够完成其继续同德意志帝国战争的保证，美利坚合众国开始向其提供经济和技术援助。

在[[東方戰線_(第一次世界大戰)|东部战线]]，俄国军队被证实不是德国和奥匈帝国军队的对手。1917年6月18日俄国人的攻势被德意志帝国军的反攻压倒性地击败。士气受挫的俄国军队，深受兵变和士兵逃跑的困扰，东部战线迅速崩溃。<!-- Only [[捷克斯洛伐克_Legion|捷克斯洛伐克 Legion]], a corps of 50,000 ethnic Slavs who had reluctantly fought with the Central Powers and subsequently switched sides after being captured by 俄国军队，remained an effective fighting force。Allied war material still in transit quickly began piling up in the already well-stocked warehouses of [[阿尔汉格尔斯克|阿尔汉格尔斯克]]和[[摩尔曼斯克|摩尔曼斯克]][[不冻港|不冻港]]。 --> 

1917年10月[[十月革命|十月革命]]推翻了克伦斯基的临时政府，5个月后[[俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国|俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国]]与德国签署了[[布列斯特-立陶夫斯克条约|布列斯特-立陶夫斯克条约]]，正式在东方战线结束了战争。这使得德国人可以重新部署军力，调往[[西方戰線_(第一次世界大戰)|西部战线]]，在那里耗尽了英国和法国军队，当时尚未得到{{Link-en|美國遠征軍|American Expeditionary Force}}的支援。<!-- Coincidental with the Treaty, [[Joseph_Stalin|Joseph Stalin]] personally pledged that if the Czech Legion would stay neutral and leave Russia, they would enjoy safe passage through Siberia on their way to join 西部战线的协约国军队。不过, as the Legion made their way along [[Trans-Siberian_Railroad|Trans-Siberian Railroad]] to Vladivostok, only half had arrived before the agreement broke down and fighting ensued in May 1918. Also worrisome to the Allies was the fact that in April 1918, a division of [[德国军队|德国军队]]在[[芬兰|芬兰]]登陆, creating fears that they might try to capture [[摩尔曼斯克铁路|Murmansk-Petrograd railroad]], the strategic port of Murmansk and possibly even 阿尔汉格尔斯克市。 -->

<!-- Faced with these series of events, the leaders of the British and French governments decided that the Allies needed to begin a military intervention in North Russia. They hoped to achieve three objectives: 

:# prevent the Allied war material stockpiles in Arkhangelsk  from falling into German or Bolshevik hands, 
:# mount an offensive to rescue the [[Czechoslovak_Legion|Czechoslovak Legion]], which was stranded along the Trans-Siberian Railroad and 
:# resurrect the Eastern Front by defeating the Bolshevik army with the assistance of the Czech Legion and an expanded anti-Bolshevik force drawn from the local citizenry. -->

<!-- Severely short of troops to spare, the British and French decided to request that President Wilson provide U.S. troops for the [[North_Russia_Campaign|North Russia Campaign]] and the Siberian Campaign. In July 1918, against the advice of his War Department, President Wilson finally agreed to a limited participation in the Campaign by 5,000 U.S. troops who were hastily organized as the American North Russia Expeditionary Force (also known as the [[Polar_Bear_Expedition|Polar Bear Expedition]]) and 10,000 U.S. troops who were similarly quickly organized and shipped from the Philippines to [[Vladivostok|Vladivostok]] as the [[American_Expeditionary_Force_Siberia|American Expeditionary Force Siberia]]. That same month the Canadian government agreed to a British request to command and furnish the majority of troops for a combined British Empire force. -->

[[大日本帝國|日本]]在這次戰爭的介入有其複1的因素：日本在這次戰爭派出的军队人数是各國中最多的，在吞併了[[大韓帝國|大韓帝國]]、[[內滿洲|內滿洲]]及部分中國的領土後，日本有非常強烈興趣去增強其在[[遠東|遠東]]的影響力、甚或再擴展其版圖。<!--The Japanese government's intense hostility to [[communism|communism]] as a potential threat to its [[monarchy|monarchy]], a determination to recoup historical losses to Russia following the [[Treaty_of_Portsmouth|Treaty of Portsmouth]], and the perceived opportunity to settle the “northern problem” in Japan's security by either creating a buffer state, or through outright territorial acquisition, were also factors.
American economic and diplomatic pressure and internal political issues, more than the military success of the Red Army, forced Japan's withdrawal. -->

The Japanese were expected to send only around 7,000 troops for the expedition, but by the end of their involvement in Siberia had deployed 70,000.

The Allies lent their support to White Russian elements from the summer of 1918.<ref name= Humphreys26/> There were tensions between the two anti-Bolshevik factions; the [[White_movement|White Russian government]] led by Admiral Alexander Kolchak and the [[Cossack|Cossack]]s led by [[Grigory_Semyonov|Grigory Semyonov]] and Ivan Kalmykov which also hampered efforts.

All Allied forces were evacuated by 1920, apart from the [[Imperial_Japanese_Army|Japanese]] who stayed until 1922.

The force was initially delayed by 3,000 Russian Bolshevik troops at [[Bandar-e_Anzali|Enzeli]] but then proceeded by ship to the port of Baku on the Caspian Sea.
