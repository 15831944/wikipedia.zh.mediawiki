'''海恒博'''（'''Alfred James Broomhall'''，{{bd|1911年|12月6日|1994年|5月11日|catIdx=B}}），[[英国|英国]][[内地会|内地会]]派往中国的医疗[[传教士|传教士]]，作家、历史学家。

==早年==
1911年12月6日，海恒博出生于中国山东烟台，父亲[[海文启|海文启]]（Benjamin Charles Broomhall）<!--  and his wife Marion, missionaries to China with the [[Baptist_Missionary_Society|Baptist Missionary Society]]. -->。海氏家族是传教士世家，<!-- and Jim was the third generation to be involved in such work.他的祖父[[Benjamin_Broomhall|Benjamin Broomhall]], had been the general secretary of 内地会 for 20 years and had married Amelia, sister of the founder of the agency, [[戴德生|戴德生]]. His uncle, [[Marshall_Broomhall|Marshall Broomhall]] was the most famous of Benjamin’s sons as a [[missionary|missionary]] and [[historian|historian]] – a professional pattern repeated in Jim’s life -->.
<!-- ==Commitment to Service==
海恒博先后就读于烟台内地会[[芝罘学校|芝罘学校]]，和[[Monkton_Combe|Monkton Combe]], [[Bath,_Somerset|Bath]], England. When 海恒博19岁时，he read a book about [[彝族|彝族]] (also called [[Nosu|Nosu]]), an isolated people of中国四川省凉山 in 。Intrigued, he made up his mind to tell them about Jesus. In preparation, like his great-uncle 戴德生before him, he became a medical doctor receiving his training at the [[Royal_London_Hospital|Royal London Hospital]]. After completing his courses, he 加入内地会 and sailed for China in [[1938|1938]]. -->
==重返中国==
在他抵达中国之前，中日战争已经爆发，日本控制了中国许多地方，旅行变得很困难，<!-- Undaunted, he and some fellow missionaries went to [[香港|香港]] where they bought station wagons which they then drove through [[French_Indochina|French Indochina]] and back over the Chinese border to [[重庆|重庆]]。海恒博决定留在中国to face the difficult times alongside the Chinese people. During this wartime, Jim practiced medicine in [[四川|四川]] at the mission hospital. -->
<!-- 1942年，海恒博与Theodora Janet Churchill (born 13 June [[1913|1913]]; died November [[2000|2000]])在中国结婚，他们有3个女儿。The couple began pioneering work among the [[Nosu|Nosu]] tribe in [[1943|1943]], They traveled among them giving medical aid and making friends. But a Japanese advance forced them to leave, still not having reached Jim's target--the Liangshan mountains. The family had to flee to [[India|India]] for safety.
Although thwarted, Jim told everyone {{quote|"I want to go to Liangshan to make friends, for there are my Yi brothers whom I love and wish to serve." }} -->
<!-- ==Return to the Nosu==
战后，Broomhalls returned to China in [[1946|1946]] and Broomhall went to Nosuland, leaving his wife and two daughters at [[Luoshan|Luoshan]], southwest China, for a while. In the end the Broomhalls spent four more years among the Nosu and established a clinic before the arrival of the Communists. In [[1947|1947]] Jim finally arrived at the place he had dedicated his life to serve, a region in southwestern Sichuan where he could minister again to the [[彝族|彝族]]. He had traveled the thousand miles from [[兰州|兰州]]到凉山。He opened a clinic to help the sick and to spread the [[Gospel|Gospel]] at the same time. He was greatly loved by the local people. In order to dispel the misunderstanding and fear the public had for people with [[leprosy|leprosy]], he invited a leper to live in his house for a year. The Yi were appalled when Jim took in a leper. The two shared a room and ate the same food. The villagers were so outraged that the leper would endanger Jim this way that they wanted to kill him, but his condition improved, although the irreversible damage could not be undone. Jim often traveled far and wide by donkey to treat patients in remote mountain areas for free. -->
<!-- Jim rode a mule along the river banks, treating patients and inviting them 到他的诊所。On one occasion he removed a young man's festering arm (it had been damaged in a [[dynamite|dynamite]] explosion) and replaced it with an artificial limb, much to the joy of the boy's family. One summer he rode his mule up into remote mountain villages, tending the sick. 
Without even the aid of an x光机, Jim performed two operations on a girl with a crippling bone disease and gave her a new life. Multiply these instances by hundreds and you can see why the Yi came to love their missionary doctor. --> 
1951年，海恒博夫妇和4个女儿被软禁几个月后，在年底被共产党趕出中国，许多彝族人来为他送行。
<!-- ==A New Focus==
Broomhall's investigations as to whether the CIM could undertake medical work in [[Thailand|Thailand]] led to three hospitals being founded there; also a pioneering missionary among the [[Mangyan|Mangyan]] people of the island of [[Mindoro|Mindoro]] in [[菲律宾|菲律宾]] for 11 years from [[1953|1953]] until he retired. -->
<!-- ==Writing career==
When he retired as a doctor, putting down his surgical knives, he started picking up his pen to record history. He spent over a decade going through the vast range of records regarding Hudson Taylor and the China Inland Mission. Consequently, he wrote the most comprehensive and reliable biography of Hudson Taylor. Broomhall subsequently held a number of positions in the OFM's national office at [[Newington_Green|Newington Green]], London. -->
==最后访问中国==
<!--1988年, although in ill health, he obtained permission to visit the Yi again. He returned to the region in Sichuan where he had first ministered to the Yi people. He left in tears, declaring he wanted to return again in two years. By then he was deaf and [[paralyzed|paralyzed]] along one side of his body, but people ran to tell each other that Dr. Broomhall was back. A woman knelt before him with a ring, given to her by her mother. {{quote|"You healed my mother. When she was dying, she gave me her ring and said I must give it to you."}} During a subsequent return in [[1991|1991]], he donated US$20,000 worth of medical equipment to the local hospital. {{quote|""The people of Liangshan have been such a support and help to me," he said. "I will never forget their friendship."}} Knowing he could never return again, the teary-eyed doctor picked up a clod of earth to take home with him. Three years later Jim died on, May 11, 1994. He was 82. His work lives on in the Christian lives he left behind and in the several books he wrote about the Yi. -->
