Screenwriter [[Michael_Arndt|麦可·安特]] said that he found Lucasfilm President [[凱斯琳·甘迺迪_(電影監製)|Kathleen Kennedy]]'s offer to write the ''Star Wars'' sequel trilogy daunting in mid-2012, but he became interested when it was explained to him that the tale was about the origin story of a female Jedi and he met with [[George_Lucas|乔治·卢卡斯]].{{sfn|"Waking the Giant"|2015}} The character was a young woman known as Kira in the early stages of production, and 阿恩特 described her as a "loner, hothead, gear-head, badass".{{sfn|Szostak|2015}} 阿恩特 said that he struggled with introducing the young woman as the main character in his story while keeping her from being overshadowed after her early meeting with the [[卢克·天行者|Luke Skywalker]] character.{{sfn|"Waking the Giant"|2015}} Ridley recalled that director and writer [[J._J._Abrams|J·J·艾布斯]] originally intended to name the character "Keera", however during filming in [[阿布扎比|阿布扎比]], 艾布斯 revealed to Ridley that he was thinking of going with "Rey".{{sfn|Barrett|2017}}

On creating a female lead for the new trilogy, 艾布斯 stated that from his initial discussions with writer {{link-en|勞倫斯·卡斯丹|Lawrence Kasdan}}, he was excited at the concept of having a woman at the center of the story. He said that "We always wanted to write Rey as the central character" and that other female representation in the story was also important.{{sfn|Pulver|2015}} 甘迺迪 stated that, "Rey is the new generation's Luke Skywalker."{{sfn|Turner|2015}} Rey's background as a scavenger was part of the developers attempting to portray her as "the ultimate outsider and the ultimate disenfranchised person", due to their belief that a person of that nature would likely experience a prolonged journey compared to other types of people.{{sfn|McKnight|2016}}

Daisy Ridley was largely unknown before being cast for the role of Rey. Ridley said that she auditioned many times for the role over the course of seven months and had to keep her casting a secret for three months.{{sfn|Siegel|2015}} She was announced as part of the cast at the end of April 2014. She only had experience with small parts in TV shows. Her inexperience and lack of exposure were a crucial part of what convinced 艾布斯 to give Ridley the role, as the previous installments had featured relatively unknown talent that would not experience heightened degrees of scrutiny.{{sfn|Saner|2015}} 艾布斯 stated that Ridley "was so funny and had a great spark", as well as having her act out an emotional scene, proclaiming that "she nailed it on the first take." 艾布斯 would go on to praise Ridley, stating "She was born with this gift to be in a moment and make it her own. She simultaneously works from the inside out and the outside in."{{sfn|Plattner|2015}} 甘迺迪 proclaimed "Daisy had a physicality and a self-confidence that was so important to the character we were looking for. She epitomizes that optimism where anything is possible."{{sfn|Plattner|2015}} Director Dusan Lazarevic, who was present at the casting of Ridley for a role in British drama series ''[[Silent_Witness|Silent Witness]]'', in addition to praising her acting range, stated "She showed a combination of vulnerability and strength which gave her a complexity, and there was an intelligence in her eyes that was an indicator she could play quite a complicated part."{{sfn|Saner|2015}} Cailey Fleming was additionally cast to portray a young Rey.{{sfn|Favre|2016}}

Although Ridley expressed that she was "riddled with doubts and insecurities", she stated that Rey's hopefulness is what she related to most in Rey, going on to say it "was something driving me through the auditions—even though it felt so insanely out of anything that I could've imagined."{{sfn|Prudom|2015b}} Ridley recalled her shooting experience as starting off bumpy, with 艾布斯 telling her that her first few takes were "wooden".{{sfn|Bartleet|2015}} However, Ridley and 艾布斯 had an "incredibly collaborative" process with creating Rey; Ridley recalled that the character "changed from when we first began, she became softer. And I think that's probably me, because Americans tend not to understand me, so it helped, slowing down the speech and everything just made it softer than I am."{{sfn|Prudom|2015b}} On her character, Ridley has stated that Rey will have "some impact in a girl power-y way", adding that the character "doesn't have to be one thing to embody a woman in a film. It just so happens she's a woman but she transcends gender. She's going to speak to men and women."{{sfn|Yamato|2015a}} In an interview with ''[[Elle_(magazine)|Elle]]'', Ridley would continue describing her character, "She's so strong. She's cool and smart and she can look after herself," adding "Young girls can look at her and know that they can wear trousers if they want to. That they don't have to show off their bodies."{{sfn|Plattner|2015}}

作曲家[[John_Williams|約翰·威廉斯]]说道他立刻喜爱上了电影中的蕾德莉，并且他将创作''{{link-en|芮主题曲|Star Wars: The Force Awakens (soundtrack)}}''（{{lang-en|'''Rey's Theme'''}}）视为很有趣的挑战。他说道她的主题曲并不表示一部爱情主题曲，而是展示了一位顽强的女性冒险者。她是一位战士，为[[原力|原力]]所充斥，因此这音乐必须是雄壮但又充满深思的。<!-- "It's an interesting challenge with her," he said, "because it doesn't suggest a love theme in any way. It suggests a female adventurer, but with great strength. She's a fighter, she's infused with the Force, and it needed to be something that was strong but thoughtful." -->{{sfn|Greiving|2015}}

''芮主题曲''与标志性的''原力主题曲''在和弦上紧密相关，在''[[原力覺醒|原力覺醒]]''的片尾曲中，威廉斯将两曲[[对位法|对位演奏]]。
{{sfn|Greiving|2015}}

威廉斯表示''芮主题曲''的“音乐语言”并非是像一部英雄主题曲一样；而像是一部冒险主题曲，也许将不仅仅拘泥于带来最宏大胜利的曲终;同时还需要展现出他对角色所怀有的同情心。<!-- "Her theme has a musical grammar that is not heroic in the sense of a hero’s theme; it’s kind of an adventure theme that maybe promises more than resolving itself in the most major, triumphant resolutions." -->
{{sfn|Dornbush|2016}}{{sfn|"The Sound of a Galaxy"|2016}}

== 出场 ==

=== 原力覺醒（2015年） ===
芮是一名在賈庫星上長大的拾荒者，平日是在沙漠中四處尋找可用的機械零件與材料換取食物等日常用品維生。

某日，芮在結束了一次拾荒的行動後遇見了正被其他拾荒者想拿去賣掉的[[BB-8|BB-8]]，她將對方趕走後收留了BB-8，並將它帶到了市集上。在市集的管理者欲收購BB-8不得後，便意圖用搶奪的手段奪走BB-8，本來想置之不管的芮最後還是將搶奪者趕走，並在之後從BB-8的提醒下發現了穿著[[波·戴姆倫|波·戴姆倫]]的飛行員夾克的[[芬恩|芬恩]]。兩人在起了爭執後，芬恩為了不被當成是小偷便謊稱自己也是抵抗勢力的成員；隨後因BB-8被偵查兵發現，市集遭到空襲，芮駕駛荒廢多年的[[千年隼号|千年隼号]]載著三者逃離賈庫星。

三人在逃離[[第一軍團|第一軍團]]的追擊後遇見了千年鷹號的原始主人[[韓·索羅|韓·索羅]]和[[丘巴卡|丘巴卡]]，但韓的債主群找上門而使雙方展開追逐。五人順利離開後，韓將他們帶到他的朋友瑪茲·卡娜塔那裡。芬恩不想再扯入紛爭而決定離開此處前往邊境星域，芮則在聽從內心的呼喚下於地下室中發現了曾由[[安納金·天行者|安納金·天行者]]與路克所使用的[[光劍|光劍]]，並看到了過去所發生的景象。但難以接受瑪茲的說法的芮最後逃進了森林並打算不再介入此事。不料，凱羅·忍的部隊襲來，為了不讓BB-8落入對方手中，芮在森林中和風暴兵相抗，但最後不敵凱羅·忍的原力而被捕。

於[[弒星者基地|弒星者基地]]中，凱羅·忍意圖用原力套出芮已知的路克·天行者所在地的地圖，但在芮本身初步覺醒的原力抵抗下失敗；之後芮趁凱羅·忍離開時以原力催眠了風暴兵逃走，途中遇見了來相救自己和意圖摧毀基地的芬恩與韓等人。

在凱羅·忍拒絕回歸光明而選擇黑暗面殺死了自己的父親韓後，芬恩和芮對上了重傷的他，芬恩拿起路克的光劍與凱羅·忍對峙卻敗下，芮則爆發原力用光劍重創了凱羅·忍。在搭乘丘巴卡開的千年鷹號離開，回到抵抗勢力基地後，芮透過BB-8和[[R2-D2|R2-D2]]結合的地圖知道了路克的所在位置，並搭乘千年鷹號來到了路克的面前，將光劍遞出要還給路克。

=== 最後的絕地武士（2017年） ===
起初路克對芮態度冷淡，不願意訓練她，直到[[R2-D2|R2-D2]]播出[[莉亞公主|莉亞公主]]當年向[[歐比王|歐比王]]求救的片段，路克才勉強願意對芮進行短期的訓練，令芮成為他臨終前最後一位絕地學徒。在訓練過程中，芮和凱羅忍陷入了一股力量之中，使得她能夠用心靈感應與忍進行交流，但在與忍進行交流過程中讓她開始質疑天行者對忍所做的一切。為了能夠使忍重返光明面，她最終離開了路克，並前往[[第一軍團|第一軍團]]艦隊尋找忍。

當芮到達[[第一軍團|第一軍團]]艦隊時，她被凱羅忍帶到斯諾克的房間。斯諾克聲稱，他建立了芮和忍之間的連接，使他可以透過芮身處的位置找到路克，並派人到[[Ahch-To|Ahch-To]]殺害他。斯諾克在得知路克的位置後，便下令[[凱羅忍|凱羅忍]]斬殺芮，但此時凱羅忍背叛了他的主人並殺害他。斯諾克死後，凱羅忍游説芮和他重建整個銀河系的秩序。但芮拒絕他的請求，並和[[丘巴卡|丘巴卡]]逃回[[千年隼号|千年隼号]]，返回反抗軍基地。

最後，路克使用戰鬥冥想演化出分身與第一軍團對峙，令芮可以有足夠時間協助反抗軍逃脫。在路克臨死前，認定了芮為其繼承人。
