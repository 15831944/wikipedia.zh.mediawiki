==生平==
===球會===
<!--
;葉士域治
Born in [[Harlow|Harlow]], [[Essex|Essex]], Ambrose started his career at [[Ipswich_Town_F.C.|Ipswich Town]] and made his debut as an 18-year-old against [[Arsenal_F.C.|Arsenal]] on 21 April 2002, replacing [[Martijn_Reuser|Martijn Reuser]] during a 2–0 defeat at [[Arsenal_Stadium|Highbury]]. Ipswich lost their Premiership status the following month, though Ambrose started brightly in the next campaign, scoring on his full debut in a 2–0 victory against [[Walsall_F.C.|Walsall]] at the Bescot stadium, and went on to score ten more goals in a total of thirty-seven appearances, combining superbly throughout the season with his close friend, striker [[Darren_Bent|Darren Bent]]. In March, however, with Ipswich having fallen into administration, Ambrose was sold to  [[Newcastle_United_F.C.|Newcastle United]] for what was considered a bargain £1m.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/n/newcastle_united/2882977.stm|title= Ambrose signs for Magpies |date=2003-03-25|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=2009-07-02}}</ref> The sale was ordered by the administrators, and completed at Newcastle by former Ipswich manager [[Bobby_Robson|Bobby Robson]]. Ambrose was reportedly upset to leave Ipswich.

;紐卡素
After returning from a short injury lay-off, Ambrose made his début for the Magpies on 11 May 2003 against [[West_Bromwich_Albion_F.C.|West Brom]], the final day of the 2002–03 Premier League season, and became a success during his first full season with the Toon, amassing three goals in 37 appearances, including one on his European début, against [[NAC_Breda|NAC Breda]] in the UEFA Cup, and another during a thrilling 3–3 draw with [[Southampton_F.C.|Southampton]] at St. Mary's Stadium in May. 
Ambrose scored another three goals in [[2004–05_in_English_football|2004–05]], scoring a notable long-range effort against [[Bolton_Wanderers_F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] at the [[Reebok_Stadium|Reebok Stadium]] on Halloween, however moments like these were sparse as he made only 12 Premiership appearances for the club under new manager [[Graeme_Souness|Graeme Souness]]. After being in and out of the team for most of the season, Ambrose was called back into the starting line up for a match against [[Manchester_United_F.C.|Manchester Utd]] at [[Old_Trafford|Old Trafford]] on 24 April 2005. In a game that Newcastle eventually lost 2–1 thanks to Wayne Rooney's memorable strike, Ambrose was his team's outstanding performer and capped the performance with a fine solo goal. Many pundits claimed that this was the sort of form that convinced previous manager Sir Bobby Robson to fork out a seven-figure sum for the player, though he would ultimately fail to gain a regular place in the starting line-up.

Eventually he voiced his frustrations at the lack of first team opportunities, declaring that while he had warmed to Newcastle and its fans, he was in need of regular games and starts, something that Souness couldn't guarantee the player. A number of clubs expressed their interest in him, including Aston Villa and Blackburn, although he would eventually sign with Alan Curbishley's Charlton Athletic, stating on his arrival at the London club that his lack of chances in the Newcastle first team were a big contributor to his decision to join up with the Addicks. In total, he scored 6 goals in 56 appearances for United.<ref>[http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11678_2341953,00.html Sky Sports – "Ambrose wants to play" SkySports Joins Charlton]</ref>

;查爾頓
He joined [[Charlton_Athletic_F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] on 8 July 2005 for a fee estimated to be in the region of £1.5 million,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/c/charlton_athletic/4663085.stm|title= Charlton sign Newcastle's Ambrose |date=2005-07-08|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=2009-07-02}}</ref> stating that he was delighted to move to as big an ambitious and determined club as the Addicks and believed that Alan Curbishley was the perfect man to develop himself into a better player and further his footballing education. Things started well at his new club, as they won their first four matches of the new Premier League season, with Darren Bent (who had joined up with Ambrose once again after moving from Ipswich in the summer) in particularly good form. Ambrose scored his first goal for his new club on 22 October 2005, against Portsmouth at Fratton Park, in a 2–1 victory for his side. However, Charlton's form dropped dramatically as the season progressed and despite the player scoring three more goals against Manchester United (a brilliant 25-yard effort in November that levelled the scores at 1–1), Blackburn (in the 4th round of the League Cup) and Sunderland at The Valley respectively, the team eventually slumped to an 11th place finish in the table, despite  Bent's 22 goal haul and Ambrose's impressive form in midfield. Things got worse for Ambrose as Curbishley left the club after 15 years of service.

Iain Dowie was named as Curbishley's successor, joining from London rivals Crystal Palace (a future club of Ambrose), after much controversy surrounding his departure. The 2006–07 season got off to a dismal start, with only two league wins by November. On 13 November 2006, the Charlton hierarchy had decided enough was enough, and relieved Dowie of his post. After youth team coach Les Reed had a short stint in charge, Alan Pardew was unveiled as Charlton's third manager of the season and fourth of the year, on Christmas Eve 2006. The club's results miraculously improved under the stewardship of the former West Ham manager and Ambrose began to regain the promising form he had shown in glimpses at Newcastle and during his first season with Athletic. Ambrose grabbed his first goal of the season against Fulham at The Valley on 27 December 2006, though the team were held to a 2–2 draw after a last minute Cottagers equaliser. Ambrose also found the net in a 4–0 defeat of Pardew's former club, West Ham at The Valley, on 24 February, rounding off the scoring after the team had led 3–0 at half-time. Ambrose scored a crucial goal in the very next match, a 2–2 draw with fellow struglers Watford at Vicarage Road, pulling a goal back for his team after the Hornets raced into an early 2–0 lead. Despite further improving results, the early season poor form of the team ultimately proved to much to gain points back on and after a 2–0 home defeat to high-flying Tottenham on 7 May, the team were relegated to English football's second tier for the first time since 2000.

There was much speculation regarding a transfer exodus during the summer transfer window, with Ambrose's name mentioned as one of those players in the exodus. However, Pardew and Ambrose stayed loyal to the club and despite the inevitable sale of Darren Bent, who moved to Spurs for a fee in excess of £16.5 million, many of Charlton's key player's remained with the Addicks. At the beginning of the 2007–08 season, Charlton were widely tipped to bounce straight back up the top flight, however, just as in the previous season, the team made a less than impressive start, with mixed early results piling pressure on Pardew and his job. Despite Ambrose's team boasting among one of the best squads in the division, and results against the bigger teams in the division proving this fact, inconsistency proved the teams biggest downfall, and they despite Ambrose hitting nine goals in 42 appearances, he could not prevent the club from finishing in a disappointing 11th place.

After failing to gain promotion back to the Premier League in 2007–08, Ambrose was sent to former club Ipswich Town on loan in the first half of the [[2008–09_in_English_football|2008–09]] season due to financial reasons, (ironically under similar circumstances to that of when Ambrose first moved from Ipswich in 2003)<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/i/ipswich_town/7721498.stm|title= Ambrose rejoins Ipswich on loan |date=2008-11-11|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=2009-07-02}}</ref> with rumors that Ipswich were reportedly interested in making the deal permanent in January 2009 for an estimated fee of £250,000, although no deal eventually materialised. He made nine appearances with no goals for the club, making his debut against Doncaster Rovers on 15 November 2008 and playing his last match on Boxing Day in a 1–0 defeat to Birmingham at Portman Road. On 2 January 2009, Ambrose returned to Charlton, who by now were fighting relegation for the second time in three years. Pardew had left the club by mutual consent in October and former Colchester and Hull boss Phil Parkinson was now in charge of improving the Addicks fortunes. He scored the winner in a 1–0 FA Cup Third Round Replay win over Norwich City, and played in most of Athletic's remaining fixtures. He ended his four year stint with the club with a total of 17 goals from 127 appearances in all competitions.<ref>[http://www.sportinglife.com/football/news/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=nonwire_soccer/08/12/31/manual_172308.html Ambrose Back With Addicks]</ref>

;水晶宮
With his contract at Charlton ending at the end of that season, Ambrose was free to leave the club, and decided to remain in South London, joining [[South_London_derby|local rivals]] [[Crystal_Palace_F.C.|Crystal Palace]]. He set a career-best record of 12 goals in 20 games by November, a run that saw him named as the division's Player of the Month for the November.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.football-league.co.uk/page/ChampionshipHome/0,,10794,00.html |title=Ambrose named Player of the Month |date=2009-12-05 |accessdate=2009-12-05 |publisher=[[The_Football_League|The Football League]]}}</ref> Ambrose ended the season with a goal against [[Sheffield_Wednesday_F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday F.C.]] that saved the club from relegation and subsuquently from extinction as well. He finished the season with 20 goals in all competitions. With Crystal Palace in administration, it was looking certain that Ambrose was going to leave at the end of the season, and was set to join [[Queens_Park_Rangers_F.C.|QPR]], but he signed a new 3-year contract with Crystal Palace on 26 July 2010.<ref>[http://www.cpfc.co.uk/page/News/0,,10323~2102768,00.html cpfc.co.uk Ambrose signs new Eagles deal]</ref>

In the 2010-11 season, Ambrose didn't play  much due to injury. Although he still scored some important goals for the club to help them in the battle against relegation. Some of these goals were his trademark long range goals. These include against [[Preston_North_End_F.C.|Preston North End F.C.]], [[Watford_F.C.|Watford F.C.]] and a spectacular volley vs [[Sheffield_United_F.C.|Sheffield United F.C.]] 

In the 2011-12 season, Ambrose was again more of a squad player, featuring more from the bench than his first season at Palace. On 30 November 2011, in his 99th game in all competitions for Crystal Palace, Ambrose scored a 35 yard long range shot at [[Old_Trafford|Old Trafford]] and then got an assist for [[Glenn_Murray|Glenn Murray's]] goal in Crystal Palace's 2-1 win over [[Manchester_United_F.C.|Manchester United]] in the Carling Cup Quarter Final.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/match/70292/manchester-united-vs-crystal-palace/report |title=Manchester United 1-2 Crystal Palace (AET): Ambrose wonderstrike & Murray winner dump weakened hosts out of League Cup |date=2011-12-01 |accessdate=2012-12-01 |publisher=goal.com}}</ref> United legend Gary Neville described the strike as the best goal scored by an away side ever at Old Trafford.
