'''希奥利艾'''（[[立陶宛语|立陶宛语]]：'''Šiauliai'''；[[德语|德语]]:'''Schaulen'''，'''施奥伦'''）是[[立陶宛|立陶宛]]第四大城市，[[希奥利艾县|希奥利艾县]]首府，也是该国北部的主要城市，人口129,075人。

== 历史 ==
<!-- The city was first mentioned in written sources as ''Soule'' in [[Livonian_Order|Livonian Order]]chronicles describing the [[battle_of_the_Sun|battle of the Sun]]. Thus the city's founding date is now considered to be [[September_22|September 22]], [[1236|1236]], the same date when the battle took place, not far from Šiauliai. At first developed as a defense post against the raids by [[条顿骑士|条顿骑士]] and [[Livonian_Order|Livonian Order]]s. After the [[battle_of_Grunwald|battle of Grunwald]] in 1410, the raids stopped and Šiauliai started to develop as an agricultural settlement. In 1445, a wooden church was built. It was replaced in 1634 with the brick church which can be seen in the city center today. -->

1589年，希奥利艾获得马哥德堡权利。16世纪成为该地区行政中心。不过，在17世纪和18世纪，该市被洪水摧毁，又遭到黑死病的袭击。 

<!-- The credit for the city's rebirth goes to [[Antoni_Tyzenhaus|Antoni Tyzenhaus]] (1733-1785) who after a violent revolt of peasants of the Crown properties in the Northern 立陶宛(so-called in Polish: Powstanie Szawelskie, 1769), started the radical economic and urban reforms. He decided to rebuilt the city according to the [[古典主义|古典主义]] ideas: at first houses were built randomly in a radial shape, but Tyzenhaus decided to build the city in an orderly rectangular. Šiauliai grew to become a well-developed city, with several prominent brick buildings. In 1791 [[Stanisław_August_Poniatowski|Stanisław August Poniatowski]],[[波兰立陶宛联邦|波兰立陶宛联邦]]国王, confirmed once again that Šiauliai's city rights and granted it the coat of arm. It depicted a bear, the symbol of [[Samogitia|Samogitia]], [[Eye_of_Providence|Eye of Providence]], and a red bull, the symbol of Poniatowski family. The modern coat of arms was modeled after this version. -->

波兰被瓜分以后，希奥利艾获得了一个新的市徽。该市发展成为一个重要的文化教育中心，基础设施也得到迅速改进：在1836-1858年兴建了连接[[里加|里加]]与Tilsit的道路，1871年修建了从Liepāja到Romny的铁路。希奥利艾作为重要商路的十字路口，开始发展为一个工业城镇。在1897年，它成为立陶宛的第三大城市，人口大约有16,000人。人口构成也发生变化，在1909年有56.4%的居民是[[犹太人|犹太人]]。希奥利艾以皮革工业著称，Chaim Frenkel 拥有俄罗斯帝国最大的皮革工厂。

[[第一次世界大战|第一次世界大战]]期间，希奥利艾的市中心和大约65%的建筑物被烧毁。战后，立陶宛失去了首都[[维尔纽斯|维尔纽斯]]（划给波兰），希奥利艾的重要性有所增加。在[[克莱佩达|克莱佩达]]归属立陶宛之前，希奥利艾是人口规模仅次于考纳斯的立陶宛第二大城市。在1929年，市中心得到重建，建起了现代化的设施：路灯、公共交通、电话、供水系统和下水道。

在第一次独立期间，经历了困难时期，因为工业城市失去了在俄国的市场。
<!-- It needed to find new clients in the Western Europe. In 1932 a railroad to Klaipėda was built and it connected the city to the western markets. In 1938 the city produced about 85% of Lithuania's leather, 60% of footwear, 75% of [[flax|flax]] fiber, 35% of candies. Culture also flourished as many new periodicals were printed, new schools and universities opened, a library, theater, museum, and [[normal_school|normal school]] were opened. -->

<!-- In [[1939|1939]], one quarter of the city's population was Jewish ([http://www.shtetlinks.jewishgen.org/shavli/shavli2.html#Prologue source]). [[Nazi_Germany|German Nazis]] entered Šiauliai on Thursday, [[June_26|June 26]], [[1941|1941]]. According to one of the Jewish survivors of Siauliai, [[Nesse_Godin|Nesse Godin]], some 1000 people were shot in nearby woods during the first weeks of occupation after having been forced to bury their own graves. There were two [[ghetto|ghetto]] areas in Siauliai,考纳斯的一个郊区, and one in Traku. During [[World_War_II|World War II]], the Jewish population was reduced from 8,000 to 500. About 80% of the buildings were destroyed. -->
== 名胜 ==
希奥利艾最著名的名胜是[[十字架山|十字架山]]。

<!-- There is an arch at the intersection of Vilniaus Str. and Vasario 16-osios str.  Legend tells that if one thinks of a wish and passes under the arch, the wish will come true.  But, if one forgets about it and walks back under the arch, the wish will vanish into thin air.

[[Zubov|Zubov]]'s Palace, located at Ausros Alley 50, was constructed in 17世纪.  The exterior has remained unchanged since 1875.  Today the palace houses the Faculty of Arts of [[Šiauliai_University|Šiauliai University]]. -->
