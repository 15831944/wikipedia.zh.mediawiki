He was given the title [[Prince_of_Condé|Prince of Condé]], originally borne by the House of [[Bourbon-Condé|Bourbon-Condé]], however on the death of [[Louis_Henri,_Prince_of_Condé|Louis Henri, Prince of Condé]], it died out. With reference to the most renowned bearer of the title, ''[[le_Grand_Condé|le Grand Condé]]'', the young  Louis d’Orléans was given the [[nickname|nickname]] ''"le petit Condé"''.<ref name=Barko>{{cite journal|url=http://www.msp.unimelb.edu.au/index.php/explorations/article/view/207/187 |title='Le petit Condé: the death in Sydney in 1866 of Australia's first royal visitor |first=Ivan |last=Barko |journal=Explorations - Journal of French-Australian Connections |issue=35 |date=December 2003 |pages=26–32 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424023612/http://www.msp.unimelb.edu.au/index.php/explorations/article/view/207/187 |archivedate=2013-04-24 |df= }}</ref>

Following the outbreak of the [[French_Revolution_of_1848|French Revolution of 1848]], he and his family went into exile in England. Later he attended the [[Royal_High_School,_Edinburgh|Royal High School]] in [[Edinburgh|Edinburgh]], where he was taught by [[Leonhard_Schmitz|Leonhard Schmitz]].<ref name=Barko/>

=== Journey to Australia ===
When Louis d’Orléans was 20 years old, his father arranged an 18-month world tour for him. In the view of his father, a journey through climes beyond the borders of Europe would improve his ailing health. Together with his doctor, [[Paul_Gingeot|Paul Gingeot]], and his cousin, [[Prince_Ferdinand,_Duke_of_Alençon|Prince Ferdinand, Duke of Alençon]], Louis d’Orléans began his journey on 4 February 1866 in [[Southampton|Southampton]] on the ''Mongolia'', a [[passenger_ship|passenger ship]] owned by British [[shipowner|shipping line]], [[Peninsular_and_Oriental_Steam_Navigation_Company|Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company]] (P&O). The itinerary was to take him to [[Egypt|Egypt]], [[Sri_Lanka|Ceylon]], [[Australia|Australia]], [[New_Zealand|New Zealand]], [[Java_(island)|Java]], [[China|China]], [[Japan|Japan]] and [[India|India]]. Louis d’Orléans was especially interested in Australia; he was fascinated by its exotic nature.<ref name=Barko/>

Because the [[Suez_Canal|Suez Canal]] was still not completed in 1866, after his arrival in [[Alexandria|Alexandria]] he travelled by train via [[Cairo|Cairo]] to [[Suez|Suez]] and then took a smaller ship to join up eventually with the ''Bengal'', another P&O passenger ship, on which Louis d’Orléans and Gingeot continued their journey. Ferdinand d’Orléans, Duke of Alençon, had left the group in Egypt in order to go on to [[Manila|Manila]]. After a short stay in [[Ceylon|Ceylon]], they continued their travels on the P&O liner, ''Bombay''.<ref name=Barko/>

On 8 April the ''Bombay'' reached [[King_George_Sound|King George Sound]], a [[bay|bay]] on the southwest coast of [[Western_Australia|Western Australia]]. Louis d’Orléans went ashore at [[Albany,_Western_Australia|Albany]], accompanied by a wealthy businessman from Queensland, and met there, amongst others, the ''Chief Magistrate'' of Albany, Sir Alexander Campbell.<ref name=Barko/>

On 13 April the ''Bombay'' entered the port at [[Melbourne|Melbourne]]. Louis d’Orléans, who wanted to get to Sydney as soon as possible, decided to visit the city on his return journey. The ''Bombay'' continued along past the colonies of [[South_Australia|South Australia]], [[Victoria_(Australia)|Victoria]] and [[New_South_Wales|New South Wales]], past [[Cape_Howe|Cape Howe]] and the [[Australian_Alps|Australian Alps]].<ref name=Barko/>

On 16 April 1866 the ''Bombay'' tied up at [[Port_Jackson|Port Jackson]]. d’Orléans was very impressed by the town and compared it to old towns around the world.<ref name=Barko/>

[[File:L'hôtel_de_Sydney_où_mourut_le_prince_de_Condé_en_1866.png|thumb]]
Although several people, including the Governor  of New South Wales, Sir [[John_Young,_1st_Baron_Lisgar|John Young]], offered d’Orléans and his travelling companions better accommodation, he decided to stay at ''Petty's Hotel'' on Church Hill near [[St_Philip's_Church,_Sydney|St. Philip’s]]. Over the next five weeks, d’Orléans, whose health had markedly improved, went to various social occasions, visited the  [[University_of_Sydney|University of Sydney]], the [[Australian_Museum|Australian Museum]], the [[Royal_Botanic_Gardens,_Sydney|Royal Botanic Gardens]] and [[Sydney_Hospital|Sydney Hospital]], during the course of which he met local dignitaries like [[Edward_Deas_Thomson|Edward Deas Thomson]], the [[Chancellor_(education)|Chancellor]] of the University of Sydney, and [[Charles_Moore_(botanist)|Charles Moore]], the Director of the Botanic Gardens. Other excursions took him to [[Parramatta|Parramatta]], [[Windsor,_New_South_Wales|Windsor]] and [[Kurrajong,_New_South_Wales|Kurrajong]].<ref name=Barko/>

=== Death and burial ===
On 12 May 1866 he received news of the death of his grandmother, [[Maria_Amalia_of_Naples_and_Sicily|Maria Amalia of Naples and Sicily]], which affected him badly and this, together with a [[common_cold|cold]], that he had picked up during his trip to [[Manly,_New_South_Wales|Manly]], caused his health to noticeably worsen. Dr. Gingeot ordered him to rest, but d’Orléans ignored him.<ref name=Barko/>

After a short-lived improvement, his health deteriorated rapidly, so that Dr. Gingeot sought the opinion of a second doctor. On the evening of 24 May, Louis d’Orléans died in Sydney in the presence of Dr. Gingeot, his valet and archdeacon McEnroe, who administered the [[last_rites|last rites]]. On his death, the title of Prince of Condé died out for a second, and final, time.<ref name=Barko/>

Over the next few days, various public figures visited Petty's Hotel, including Governor John Young, ''Chief Justice'' [[Alfred_Stephen|Alfred Stephen]], the Premier of New South Wales [[James_Martin_(Australian_politician)|James Martin]], Commodore Sir [[William_Wiseman,_8th_Baronet|William Wiseman]] and the Consuls of the United States, the Netherlands, Belgium and Brazil, in order to pay their last respects to d’Orléans. Louis Sentis, the French consul, unlike his peers, went as a private individual, because the French government did not recognise the claims of the [[House_of_Orléans|House of Orléans]] to the [[French_throne|French throne]].<ref name=Barko/>

[[File:Louis_d'Orléans,_prince_de_Condé.png|thumb]]]]
The funeral took place on 29 May 1866. A long procession, led by [[Bishop|Bishop]] [[Aloys_Elloy|Aloys Elloy]] and about 20 clerics, accompanied the coffin from Petty's Hotel to [[Saint_Mary’s_Cathedral,_Sydney|Saint Mary’s Cathedral]]. Amongst the coffin bearers were the  Governor, the ''Chief Justice'', the Premier, Commodore Sir William Wiseman and the Belgian consul. Many businesses in Sydney closed during the funeral and the consulates lowered their flags to half mast.<ref name=Barko/>

Two thousand attended the [[requiem_mass|requiem mass]] in Saint Mary’s Cathedral. Because  [[Archbishop|Archbishop]] [[John_Bede_Polding|John Bede Polding]] was in [[Rome|Rome]] at the time, he was represented at the service by Aloys Elloy. After the end of the service the coffin and the silver container that held the heart of Louis d’Orléans were taken on board the ''Sea Star'' which was anchored at [[Circular_Quay|Circular Quay]]. On 2 June 1866 the ''Sea Star'' set sail for London with d’Orléans' remains. Also on board were Dr. Gingeot and the prince's retinue. The ''Sea Star'' arrived in London on 11 September 1866.<ref name=Barko/>

After the end of the [[Second_French_Empire|Second French Empire]] and the [[Paris_Commune|Paris Commune]] the family of Louis d’Orléans returned to France in 1871 from their exile in England. In 1885, the urn that contained the hearts of the Princes of Condé was placed in the chapel of [[Château_de_Chantilly|Château de Chantilly]]. Here, too, is the final resting place of Louis d’Orléans' heart.<ref name=Barko/>

His mortal remains are in [[Chapelle_royale_de_Dreux|Chapelle Royale Saint-Louis]] in [[Dreux|Dreux]].<ref name=Barko/>
