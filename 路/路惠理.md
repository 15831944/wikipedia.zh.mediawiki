'''路惠理'''（'''William David Rudland'''，1839年2月 –1912年1月10日）是一位[[英国|英国]][[内地会|内地会]]派往[[中国|中国]]的第一批[[传教士|传教士]]之一，在中国传教40多年。<!-- Rudland 翻译[[新约|新约]] into the [[Taizhou|Taizhou]] vernacular (a romanized version), and published the work at the printing press that he operated with a native helper. In the year 1906 alone, Rudland's press (that had been brought over with the [[Lammermuir_Party|Lammermuir Party]] in 1866) printed 1000 Psalms with references, 500 copies of Genesis, 2000 Chinese character tracts, and 20,000 other Chinese character books.<ref>China and the Gospel (1906), p. 93</ref> -->

路惠理出生在英格兰剑桥郡 Harston，但是居住在Eversden，<!-- the son of William Rudland and Abigail Newman. He was a [[铁匠|铁匠]] and a farm mechanic by trade.

路惠理没有因缺乏正式教育而失去成为传教士的资格or ordination. The newly formed 内地会 was recruiting from all classes of society, seeking only individuals with a common devotion to the “Great Commission” given by Jesus, to “Preach the gospel to every creature”. Rudland joined the mission and accompanied the “Lammermuir Party” to China,1866年5月离开伦敦。 -->

<!-- During the treacherous 4个月的航程中 to China, Rudland made use of his blacksmith skills to make small repairs to [[Lammermuir_(clipper)|Lammermuir (clipper)]]. There were daily language lessons in [[汉语|汉语]] – something that Rudland struggled with a great deal at first. But his determination was noteworthy. He is quoted as saying:{{quote|"I could put up with anything, could I but tell (the Chinese) of a Saviour’s love."}} The group 1866年9月30日到达中国。

One of the fellow missionaries aboard the vessel was an attractive woman named Mary Bell. She had managed to gather the attention of many of the sailors to attend [[Bible|Bible]] studies with her during the voyage. Evidently, she did not go unnoticed by Rudland, either. The two were married the following year in China. --> 

最初，所有“Lammermuir Party”都由[[戴德生|戴德生]]率领，住在[[杭州|杭州]]，<!--  [[Frederick_Howard_Taylor|Frederick Howard Taylor]] and his wife, Geraldine later recalled the situation:{{quote|How little Rudland, for example, or any one else in those early days, could have foreseen the usefulness for which he was being fitted. Of all the Hangchow party he was the one who seemed, at any rate to himself, least likely to do much in China. He could not get hold of the language ; and the more he tried to study the worse became the -headaches, that left him utterly discouraged. But Mr. Taylor was developing as a leader no less than his fellow-workers along other lines.}}
{{quote|" I wonder could you spare time to help me a little ? " he said to Rudland one day, after prayerfully considering how to meet the difficulty.}}
{{quote|Gladly would I," responded the young man, " but what is there I can do ? "}}
{{quote|" Well, I am troubled about the printing-press. The workmen seem to get through so little when left to themselves, and I really have not time to look after them. You managed so well in putting the press together ; do you not think you could superintend it for me now ? "}}
{{quote|In vain Rudland protested that he knew nothing about printing.}}
{{quote|" If you will just go in and begin at the beginning," said Mr. Taylor, " the men will be pleased to show you how to set up type, etc., and the fact of your being there will keep them to their work."}}
{{quote|So Rudland left his books for the cheerful activity of the printing-room. The workmen were glad to have his company and proud to display their superior knowledge. Listening to their conversation by the hour together, he found himself picking up words and phrases more quickly than he could discover their English equivalents. It was the [[Gouin_system|Gouin system]] to perfection I and all his spare time he was fain to spend over the dictionary to make out what he had been learning. The headaches were soon conquered, and the lines laid down for a life service, that was to include the translation and printing of almost the entire Scriptures in a dialect spoken by millions to whom the Word of God was thus made accessible.}}

路惠理结婚后，the couple endured the violence of the [[扬州教案|扬州教案]] of [[1868|1868]]. One of the targets of the rioters was the printing press that Rudland operated there. -->

1869年，路惠理一家被派往浙江台州，在那里度过许多年。路惠理夫妇在中国生了几名子女：Ebenezer William Rudland于1868年生于[[江苏|江苏]][[镇江|镇江]]；Marie Annie Rudland 生于1869年11月；Charles Rudland 生于1871年；Grace Bell Rudland 生于1872年8月。

1870年，小安妮[[去世|去世]]，埋葬在杭州差会戴德生的女儿Grace Dyer Taylor之侧。不过，由于有受到中国风俗威胁的危险，她的坟墓被搬迁到镇江新教徒小公墓，仍然与戴德生家的墓地相邻。该公墓在[[文化大革命|文化大革命]]期间被摧毁。 

1874年，路惠理夫人的身体因[[肺结核|肺结核]]而衰弱，于是他们返回英国休养，她于1874年10月23日在伦敦去世。

<!-- William married another missionary named Brealey，继续在台州传教。Wallace George Rudland was born to the couple in October [[1876|1876]]. Rudland was widowed a second time in [[1878|1878]]. The following year on [[December_16|December 16]], [[1879|1879]] he was married again to another missionary named Annie K. Knight. Anna Rosa Rudland was born to them in September, [[1880|1880]].

Rudland made a second furlough to England in November of [[1887|1887]]. He returned to China and lived in Taizhou until his death of [[cancer|cancer]] in January, 1912. -->
