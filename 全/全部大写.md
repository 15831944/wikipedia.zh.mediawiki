==与吼叫的联系==
<!--用全部大写键入的文本信息在[[社会化媒体|社会化媒体]]中通常等同于[[吼叫|吼叫]]或其他不礼貌的争论行为，这在20世纪80年代网络化的计算机出现起成为主流的解释。然而在信息时代前However a similar interpretation was already evidenced by written sources that predated the computing era, in some cases by at least a century, and the textual display of shouting or emphasis online was not a settled matter as at 1984. The following sources may be relevant to the history of all-caps (taken from a [[Stack_Exchange|Stack Exchange]] [https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/41249/when-did-people-decide-that-all-caps-means-the-writer-is-shouting discussion on all-caps] in October 2017):

:* The 6 September 1958 edition of ''Bookseller: The Organ of the Book Trade'' describes writing in lower-case "rather than shouting with all caps. The effect is pleasing to anybody in a contemplative mood."
:* The 17 April 1856 ''Yorkville Enquirer'' (South Carolina) uses the expression "This time he shouted it out in capital letters".
:* The 1880 ''The Standard speaker and elocutionist'' book has a section titled "SHOUTING STYLE", which states that "This will be seldom needed throughout an entire piece, but wherever the words imply calling, or commanding, it will be in keeping with the words to employ it. As examples note the following selections marked in CAPITAL letters as the appropriate place for shouting emphasis." A large number of literature examples are given where all caps has been used for shouting. 
:* A 2014 article on [[網絡禮儀|netiquette]] (online etiquette) in ''[[新共和|New Republic]]'' titled "How Capital Letters Became Internet Code for Yelling",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/117390/netiquette-capitalization-how-caps-became-code-yelling|title=How Capital Letters Became Internet Code for Yelling|website=newrepublic.com|accessdate=6 March 2018}}</ref> which states that 
::* According to Professor Paul Luna (department of typography and graphic communication at the [[雷丁大学|University of Reading]]), all caps have been used "to convey grandeur, pomposity, or aesthetic seriousness for thousands of years", and for many years to express anger or shouting in print. Examples are cited such as pianist {{tsl|en|Philippa Schuyler||Philippa Schuyler}}’s biography titled "Composition in Black and White" in the 1940s which used all-caps to "yell", and Robert Moses in the 1970s who used all caps to "convey rage" at a draft of a book.
::* Online [[新闻组|newsgroup]]s and [[留言板|bulletin board]] posts from around 1984 show that a user still needed to explain that "if it's in caps i'm trying to YELL",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/d/msg/net.jokes.d/eA4GCKCnlAY/VgVq5JuLllcJ|title=Google Groups|website=groups.google.com|accessdate=6 March 2018}}</ref> and another summed up that there seemed to be a developing consensus that emphasis was given to words by all caps or surrounding them with *...* symbols.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/net.flame/VbghoeOfwyI/E2mClWj2GV8J|title=Google Groups|website=groups.google.com|accessdate=6 March 2018}}</ref>
:* Further online discussion in 1984 included comments such as "Capitalizing whole words gives the impression that you're shouting". ([https://groups.google.com/forum/#%21msg/net.flame/VbghoeOfwyI/E2mClWj2GV8J Thread] discussing emphasis and all-caps in online text).

All caps typography was common on teletype machines, such as those used by police departments, news, and the then-called Weather Bureau, as well as early computers, such as certain early [[Apple_II|Apple II]] models and the {{tsl|en|ZX81||ZX81}}, which had a limited support for lower-case text. This changed as full support of [[ASCII|ASCII]] became standard, allowing lower-case characters.

With the advent of the [[BBS|bulletin board system]], or BBS, and later the Internet, typing messages in all caps commonly became closely identified with "shouting" or {{tsl|en|attention-seeking||attention-seeking}} behavior, and may be considered rude. Its equivalence to shouting traces back to at least 1984 and before the internet, back to printed typography usage of all capitals to mean shouting.<ref>{{cite news|last=Robb|first=Alice|title=How Capital Letters Became Internet Code for Yelling|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/117390/netiquette-capitalization-how-caps-became-code-yelling|accessdate=18 April 2014|newspaper=[[新共和|The New Republic]]|date=17 April 2014}}</ref>  (The convention may have predated the internet, and existed in print for many years before, however - see above). 

For this reason, [[網絡禮儀|netiquette]] generally discourages the use of all caps when posting messages online. While all caps can be used as an alternative to rich-text "bolding" for a single word or phrase, to express emphasis, repeated use of all caps can be considered "shouting" or irritating.  Such poor netiquette has led to a number of cases involving employees being laid off for this particular reason.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/woman-fired-for-e-mails-in-all-caps/|title=Woman fired for e-mails in all caps|last=Matyszczyk|first=Chris|date=2009-09-01|work=CNET|access-date=2018-04-17|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}</ref>

Some aspects of Microsoft's [[现代UI|Metro Design Language]] involves the use of all caps headings and titles. This has received particular attention when [[選單|menu]] and [[Ribbon|ribbon]] titles appeared in all caps in [[Microsoft_Visual_Studio|Visual Studio 2012]] and [[Microsoft_Office_2013|Office 2013]], respectively. Critics have compared this to a computer program shouting at its user.

==可读性==
<!--
{{tsl|en|Miles Tinker||Miles Tinker}}, renowned for his landmark work, ''Legibility of Print'', performed scientific studies on the {{tsl|en|legibility||legibility}} and [[可读性|readability]] of all-capital print. His findings were as follows:

<blockquote> All-capital print greatly retards speed of reading in comparison with lower-case type. Also, most readers judge all capitals to be less legible. Faster reading of the lower-case print is due to the characteristic word forms furnished by this type. This permits reading by word units, while all capitals tend to be read letter by letter. Furthermore, since all-capital printing takes at least one-third more space than lower case, more fixation pauses are required for reading the same amount of material. The use of all capitals should be dispensed with in every printing situation.<ref>{{cite book |title= Legibility of Print|last= Tinker|first= Miles A.|year= 1963|publisher= Iowa State University Press|location= Ames, Iowa|asin=B000I52NNE |page=65}}</ref></blockquote>

According to Tinker, “As early as 1914, Starch reported that material set in Roman lower case was read somewhat faster than similar material printed in all capitals.”<ref>D. Starch, ''Advertising'', 1914, Chicago: Scott, Foresman, quoted in Miles Tinker, Bases for Effective Reading, 1965, Minneapolis, Lund Press. p. 136.</ref> Another study in 1928 showed that “all-capital text was read 11.8 percent slower than lower case, or approximately 38 words per minute slower,”<ref>M.A. Tinker and D.G. Paterson, “Influence of Type Form on Speed of Reading.” 1928, ''Journal of Applied Psychology'', Vol. 12, 359–368, in Miles Tinker, ''Bases for Effective Reading'', 1965, Minneapolis, Lund Press. p. 136.</ref> and that “nine tenths of adult readers consider lower case more legible than all capitals.”<ref name="autogenerated136">Miles Tinker, ''Bases for Effective Reading'', 1965, Minneapolis, Lund Press. p. 136.</ref>

A 1955 study by Miles Tinker showed that “all-capital text retarded speed of reading from 9.5 to 19.0 percent for the 5 and 10-minute time limits, and 13.9 percent for the whole 20-minute period.”<ref>M.A. Tinker, “The Effect of Slanted Text upon the Readability of Print.” 1954, ''Journal of Educational Psychology'', Vol. 45, 287–291, quoted in Miles Tinker, ''Bases for Effective Reading'', 1965, Minneapolis, Lund Press. p. 136.</ref> Tinker concluded that, “Obviously, all-capital printing slows reading to a marked degree in comparison with Roman lower case.”<ref name="autogenerated136"/>

Tinker provides the following explanations for why all capital printing is more difficult to read: <blockquote>Text in all capitals covers about 35 percent more printing surface than the same material set in lower case. This would tend to increase the reading time. When this is combined with the difficulty in reading words in all-capital letters as units, the hindrance to rapid reading becomes marked. In the eye-movement study by Tinker and Patterson, the principal difference in oculomotor patterns between lower case and all capitals was the very large increase in number of fixation pauses for reading the all-capital print.<ref>M. A. Tinker and D.G. Paterson, “Studies of Typographical Factors Influencing Speed of Reading: IX. Reduction in Size of Newspaper Print,” 1932, ''Journal of Applied Psychology'', Vol. 16, 525–531, quoted in Miles Tinker, ''Bases for Effective Reading'', 1965, Minneapolis, Lund Press. p. 137.</ref></blockquote>

All caps text should be eliminated from most forms of composition, according to Tinker: “Considering the evidence that all-capital printing retards speed of reading to a striking degree in comparison with lower case and is not liked by readers, it would seem wise to eliminate such printing whenever rapid reading and consumer (reader) views are of importance. Examples of this would include any continuous reading material, posters, bus cards, billboards, magazine advertising copy, headings in books, business forms and records, titles of articles, books and book chapters, and newspaper headlines.”<ref>M.A. Tinker and D.G. Paterson, “Readability of Mixed Type Forms,” 1946, ''Journal of Applied Psychology'', Vol. 30, 631–637, quoted in Miles Tinker, ''Bases for Effective Reading'', 1965, Minneapolis, Lund Press. p. 138.</ref>

Colin Wheildon stated that there is an "apparent consensus" that lower-case text is more legible, but that some editors continue to use all caps in text regardless. In his studies of all caps in [[新聞標題|headline]]s, he states that, "Editors who favor capitals claim that they give greater emphasis. Those who prefer lower case claim their preferences gives greater legibility." Wheildon, who informs us that "When a person reads a line of type, the eye recognizes letters by the shapes of their upper halves," asserts that recognizing words in all caps "becomes a task instead of a natural process."<ref>{{cite book |title= Type and Layout: How Typography and Design Can Get your Message Across - Or Get in the Way|last= Wheildon|first= Colin|year= 1995|publisher= Strathmoor Press|location= Berkeley|isbn= 0-9624891-5-8|pages=62–64}}</ref> His conclusions, based on scientific testing in 1982–1990, are: "Headlines set in capital letters are significantly less legible than those set in lower case."<ref>{{cite book |title= Type and Layout: How Typography and Design Can Get your Message Across - Or Get in the Way|last= Wheildon|first= Colin|year= 1995|publisher= Strathmoor Press|location= Berkeley|isbn= 0-9624891-5-8|page=74}}</ref>

[[John_Ryder_(Typographer)|John Ryder]], in the ''Case for Legibility'', stated that "Printing with capital letters can be done sufficiently well to arouse interest and, with short lines, reading at a slowed speed is possible – but in principle too many factors of low legibility are involved."<ref>{{cite book |title= The Case for Legibility|last= Ryder |first= John|year= 1979|publisher= Bodley Head|location= London|isbn= 0-370-30158-7|page=72}}</ref>

Other critics are of the opinion that all caps letters in text are often "too tightly packed against each other".<ref>{{cite book |title= Getting it Right with Type|last1= Squire|first1= Victoria|last2= Willberg|first2= Hans Peter|last3= Forsmann|first3= Friedrich|year= 2006|publisher= Laurence King Publishing|location= London|isbn= 978-1-85669-474-2|page= 59}}</ref>

An antiquated practice that still remains in use, especially by older American lawyers who grew up before the arrival of computers, is to use all caps text for text that is legally required to be emphasised and clearly readable.<ref name="Why is your Contract YELLING AT YOU? All Caps in Contracts, Explained.">{{cite web|title=Why is your Contract YELLING AT YOU? All Caps in Contracts, Explained.|url=http://www.shakelaw.com/blog/why-is-your-contract-yelling-at-you-all-caps-in-contracts-explained/|publisher=Shake Law|accessdate=29 July 2015}}</ref> The practice dates to the period of typewriters, which generally did not offer bold text, small capitals, or the opportunity to add marginal notes emphasising key points. Legal writing expert {{tsl|en|Bryan A. Garner||Bryan A. Garner}} has described the practice as 'ghastly'.<ref name="Legal writing in plain English : a text with exercises">{{cite book|last1=Garner|first1=Bryan A.|title=Legal writing in plain English : a text with exercises|date=2013|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0226283937|edition=Second edition.|url=http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/garner/documents/section44.html|accessdate=2 August 2015}}</ref> In 2002, a US court spoke out against the practice, ruling that simply making text all-capitals has no bearing on whether it is clear and easily readable:
<blockquote>Lawyers who think their caps lock keys are instant “make conspicuous” buttons are deluded. In determining whether a term is conspicuous, we look at more than formatting. A term that appears in capitals can still be inconspicuous if it is hidden on the back of a contract in small type. Terms that are in capitals but also appear in hard-to-read type may flunk the conspicuousness test. A sentence in capitals, buried deep within a long paragraph in capitals will probably not be deemed conspicuous...it is entirely possible for text to be conspicuous without being in capitals.<ref name="In Re: Darlene M.

{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}
Besides the aforementioned speed of reading, all caps is constitutionally prone to {{tsl|en|Character (symbol)||character}}-based ambiguities.

Namely, the upper-case letters are globally simpler than their lower-case counterpart. For example, (i.e. not limitedly), they lack [[升部|ascenders]] and [[降部|descender]]s.
Since they are built from fewer positional and building elements (e.g. a smaller grid pertaining to minimalist digital fonts), they are more fragile to small changes.

These variations, generally involuntary, sometimes induced on purpose, are caused by a misinterpretation (the information is transferred) or by a deterioration (the data is lost, in the analysis wording). They can occur horizontally or/and vertically, while misreading (without this extra effort or time), or during a delicate [[光学字符识别|scanning of characters]] (from a damaged image that needs further contextual text correction).

Depending on the [[字体|typeface]], these similarities accidentally create various duplicates (even quite brievely and without realizing it when reading).
E.g. H/A, F/E or I/T by adding a bar ; P/R, O/Q, even C/G from similar errors ; V/U, D/O, even B/S while rounding the shape ; and more deformations implying mixings.

Adding digits in all caps styled texts may multiply these confusions, which is one aim of [[Leet|Leet]] (intentional pseudo duplicates) and can provide simple means of [[隐写术|concealing messages]] (often numbers).
