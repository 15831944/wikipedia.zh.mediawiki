{{TransH}}''Air Traffic Controller 2'' made many improvements. The game is now in 3D, more airport gates, and increased to five channels of communication: Approach, Tower, Ground, Delivery, and Departure. New features included ground movements (e.g. towing planes to gates), giving correct [[Standard_Instrument_Departure|Standard Instrument Departure]], use of [[radar_vector|radar vector]]s, and changing channel frequency. The choice of [[Standard_Terminal_Arrival_Route|Standard Terminal Arrival Route]] distance eliminates the speed instruction in previous version.

In the game, there are a few conditions that will cause game over. These include [[Head-on_Collision|head-on]], [[Near_miss_(safety)|near miss]], pilots' pressure bar reaching 100%, or failed to accumulate enough points to pass that particular stage. The points are awarded according to how fast to reply a response. A slow or non-response will raise the pressure bar. Other things that increase pressure bar include instructing the plane to take off in [[tailwind|tailwind]] or tower failing to give the plane permission to land or go-around. Additional points are awarded at the end of the stage, but before deciding whether there's enough points to pass, for minimal % in pressure bar. More bonus points are awarded if the pressure bar is at 0%.

==第四代作品列表==
{{TransH}}Air Traffic Controller 4 is an air traffic control simulation game developed by TechnoBrain as a successor to the Air Traffic Controller 3. The game is compatible with Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1 and tested on Windows 10. The first installment, ATC4 - Tokyo Haneda was originally released on July 15, 2015, but the developers delayed the release of the game to August 28, 2015. TechnoBrain delayed again to September 17, 2015 for testing the Windows 10 compatibility. Airport and airplanes are more realistically scaled. In-game time are now progressing at the same speed as real time. There are now even more gates than the previous games. There are also stages based on the actual schedule of the airports of which the players can select the time frame and channels they wish to take charge. Players can't choose runway for the plane to takeoff, landing or even go-around except the runway section (e.g. 16L, 16R. etc.) are opened (only for ATC4 - Tokyo Haneda). Unlike the previous games, if the planes are to line up to each other, the game will not result in a head-on game over (only in Normal Mode) unless the planes are heading to each other. The player can select planes at the top of it or at the flight control selection bar (bottom-right during gameplay). Technoair also appears here like in ATC3, occasionally presenting problems for players to solve or work around (for the main stages of the game) as well as replacing airlines not included in game. Similar to previous games, the game consists of two modes (Normal Mode and Game Mode). Game Mode is more challenging because player needs to pay attention to the planes on the ground to prevent head-on game over. The game consists of five installments as of April 18, 2018.{{TransF}}
