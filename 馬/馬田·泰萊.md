Loan spells at [[Darlington_F.C.|Darlington]] and [[Stockport_County_F.C.|Stockport]] served to improve his self-belief,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/worthington_cup/1823018.stm |title=Blackburn squad profiles |publisher=BBC Sport |date=19 February 2002 |accessdate=27 March 2007}}</ref> and in May 2001 he won his first and only cap for the [[England_national_under-21_football_team|England under-21 side]], as a half-time substitute for [[John_Terry|John Terry]] in a 3–0 friendly win against [[Mexico_national_under-20_football_team|Mexico]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2001/may/25/newsstory.sport3 |title=No substitute for England class |first=Adrian |last=Milledge |work=The Guardian |date=25 May 2001 |accessdate=25 October 2012}}</ref> Though brought into the squad for the [[2002_UEFA_European_Under-21_Football_Championship|2002 European under-21 championships]] to replace the injured [[Ledley_King|Ledley King]], he made no further international appearances.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2002/may/14/newsstory.sport |title=King and Carrick miss out on European showdown |first=Dominic |last=Fifield |work=The Guardian |date=14 May 2002 |accessdate=25 October 2012}}</ref>

Also in 2002, he played throughout Blackburn's [[Football_League_Cup|League Cup]] campaign, culminating in a [[2002_Football_League_Cup_Final|2–1 victory]] over [[Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] at the [[Millennium_Stadium|Millennium Stadium]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/worthington_cup/1838781.stm |title=Worthington Cup final ratings |first=Pat |last=McLoughlin |publisher=BBC Sport |date=24 February 2002 |accessdate=25 October 2012}}</ref> 

Blackburn manager [[Graeme_Souness|Graeme Souness]] felt that Taylor had enough ability to reach the top, but had for some time believed that without adopting a more aggressive physical approach – one befitting his {{height|ft=6|in=4}} frame, which caused his teammates to nickname him "Tiny" – he would not fulfil his potential.<ref name="Tiny">{{cite news |url=http://www.thisislancashire.co.uk/archive/2002/01/26/Lancashire+Archive/5988884.Souness_pleads_with__Tiny__Taylor_to_get_tough/ |title=Souness pleads with 'Tiny' Taylor to get tough |work=Lancashire Evening Telegraph |date=26 January 2002 |accessdate=25 October 2012}}</ref> He had been viewed as a potential replacement for defenders [[Henning_Berg|Henning Berg]] and [[Craig_Short|Craig Short]], but, as Berg left the side, Souness signed [[Lorenzo_Amoruso|Lorenzo Amoruso]], because he felt that Blackburn needed experienced centre-backs,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thisislancashire.co.uk/archive/2003/07/15/Lancashire+Archive/5893701.Souness_joy_at_Amo_capture/ |title=Souness joy at Amo capture |work=Lancashire Evening Telegraph |date=15 July 2003 |accessdate=25 October 2012}}</ref> and then took [[Markus_Babbel|Markus Babbel]] on loan.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thisislancashire.co.uk/archive/2003/10/01/Lancashire+Archive/5879618._Tiny__to_get_big_chance_for_Rovers/ |title='Tiny' to get big chance for Rovers |work=Lancashire Evening Telegraph |date=1 October 2003 |accessdate=25 October 2012}}</ref>

Though injuries among his defenders made him reluctant to sell, Souness needed to generate transfer funds,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://icbirmingham.icnetwork.co.uk/birmingham/news/tm_method=full&objectid=13799480&siteid=50002-name_page.html |title=Blues target tipped for England |last=Tattum |first=Colin |work=Birmingham Mail |date=9 January 2004 |accessdate=27 March 2007}}</ref> so in January 2004, Blackburn accepted a £1.25 million bid from [[Birmingham_City_F.C.|Birmingham City]].

====伯明翰城====
On 2 February 2004, Taylor left Blackburn for Birmingham City, signing a contract due to end in 2007. He linked up with former Blackburn teammates [[David_Dunn|David Dunn]] and [[Damien_Johnson|Damien Johnson]] highlighted Taylor's footballing ability and comfort on the ball.<ref>{{cite web |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050405194238/http://www.thefa.com/Features/Postings/2004/02/DavidDunn_GoodBusiness.htm |title=Good bit of business |last=Dunn |first=David |publisher=The Football Association |date=4 February 2004 |archivedate=5 April 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://icbirmingham.icnetwork.co.uk/birmingham/news/tm_method=full&objectid=13900012&siteid=50002-name_page.html |title=Damien backs Tiny to walk tall |last=Tattum |first=Colin |work=Birmingham Mail |date=31 January 2004 |accessdate=27 March 2007}}</ref> [[Rob_Kelly|Rob Kelly]], then head of youth coaching at Blackburn, while complimentary about his reading of the game and ability with both feet, felt that working with Birmingham manager [[Steve_Bruce|Steve Bruce]], a former top-class centre-half, in new surroundings might help bring out his unfulfilled potential,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://icbirmingham.icnetwork.co.uk/birmingham/news/tm_method=full&objectid=13902852&siteid=50002-name_page.html |title=Taylor looks set to sign |last=Clarkson |first=Ian |work=Sunday Mercury |location=Birmingham |date=1 February 2004 |accessdate=27 March 2007}}</ref> an assessment with which Taylor himself agreed.<ref name="BM040203">{{cite news |url=http://icbirmingham.icnetwork.co.uk/birmingham/news/tm_method=full&objectid=13909650&siteid=50002-name_page.html |title=Taylor: I am back on track |last=Tattum |first=Colin |work=Birmingham Mail |date=3 February 2004 |accessdate=27 March 2007}}</ref>

He made his Birmingham debut in a 3–0 victory against [[Everton_F.C.|Everton]], and in his next game, a 3–1 victory against [[Middlesbrough_F.C.|Middlesbrough]], he scored his first league goal for the club. Unable to dislodge the established central defensive partnership of [[Matthew_Upson|Matthew Upson]] and [[Kenny_Cunningham|Kenny Cunningham]], he played regularly for the remainder of the season, but mainly in his less favoured position of [[Defender_(association_football)#Full_back|right back]].<ref name="BM040203" />

When Bruce brought Taylor to Birmingham he mentioned his admiration for the player's ability to play in any defensive position;<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.standard.co.uk/sport/birmingham-swoop-for-taylor-7233508.html |title=Birmingham swoop for Taylor |work=Evening Standard |location=London |date=2 February 2004 |accessdate=25 October 2012}}</ref> this versatility ideally suited him to a backup role in the event of injury to any of the first choice defenders. In the [[2004-05_Birmingham_City_F.C._season|2004-05 season]], the form and fitness of Upson and Cunningham, together with the arrival of [[Netherlands_national_football_team|Dutch international]] fullback [[Mario_Melchiot|Mario Melchiot]] from [[Chelsea_F.C.|Chelsea]], considerably restricted Taylor's appearances.  In the second half of the 2005–06 season he had a long run in the side due to Upson's ankle injury, a run which coincided with some of Birmingham's better performances.<ref name=pairings>{{cite news |url=http://www.birminghammail.net/birmingham-sport/birmingham-city-fc/birmingham-city-fc-news/2008/02/12/martin-taylor-targets-the-ton-for-birmingham-city-97319-20465320/ |title=Martin Taylor targets the ton for Birmingham City |last=Tattum |first=Colin |work=Birmingham Mail |date=12 February 2008 |accessdate=12 February 2008}}<br>{{cite news |url=http://www.birminghammail.net/birmingham-sport/birmingham-city-fc/tm_objectid=17638755&method=full&siteid=50002&headline=wolves-boss-targets-blues-duo-name_page.html |title=Wolves boss targets Blues duo |last1=Tattum |first1=Colin |last2=Berry |first2=Paul |lastauthoramp=& |work=Birmingham Mail |date=26 August 2006 |accessdate=27 March 2007}}</ref>

[[Image:Martin_Taylor_signs_autographs.jpg|200px]]
The departure of Cunningham and Melchiot following Birmingham's relegation from the Premiership, with Upson still injured long-term, provided an opportunity for Taylor to establish his first-team place alongside newly arrived [[Bruno_N'Gotty|Bruno N'Gotty]]. But Bruce also recruited [[Tunisia_national_football_team|Tunisian international]] [[Radhi_Jaïdi|Radhi Jaïdi]], and preferred the more robust physical approach of [[Olivier_Tébily|Olivier Tébily]] while Jaïdi built up match fitness.<ref name=pairings/> However N'Gotty's suspension proved the catalyst for an upturn in fortunes for Taylor. He was named captain after Damien Johnson suffered a broken jaw, and his rapport with fellow centre-back Jaïdi helped Birmingham to maintain a strong position in the [[Football_League_Championship|Championship]] in the 2006–07 season. In recognition of his value to the club, in April 2007 he signed a new three-year contract with an option for a further two years.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://icbirmingham.icnetwork.co.uk/birmingham/news/tm_headline=taylor-signs-new-long%2Dterm-blues-deal&method=full&objectid=18868039&siteid=50002-name_page.html |title=Taylor signs new long-term Blues deal |last1=Tattum |first1=Colin |work=Birmingham Mail |date=6 April 2007 |accessdate=6 April 2007}}</ref>

However, Taylor was not first choice with Birmingham back in the Premier League, and did not play in a single league game in the first two months of the season. On 1 November 2007, he became new [[Norwich_City_F.C.|Norwich City]] manager [[Glenn_Roeder|Glenn Roeder]]'s first signing, joining on a month's loan.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/7073947.stm |title=Roeder swoops for defender Taylor |publisher=BBC Sport |date=1 November 2007 |accessdate=1 November 2007}}</ref> In his debut game, against [[Ipswich_Town_F.C.|Ipswich Town]] three days later, Taylor played a large role in his side's first goal, as his header was deflected in off defender [[Owen_Garvan|Owen Garvan]], who was credited with an [[own_goal|own goal]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/7065346.stm |title=Norwich 2–2 Ipswich |publisher=BBC Sport |date=4 November 2007 |accessdate=25 October 2012}}</ref> Taylor scored with a diving header against [[Blackpool_F.C.|Blackpool]]<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,,11728_2925241,00+en-USS_01DBC.html |title=Championship round-up |publisher=Sky Sports |date=27 November 2007 |accessdate=25 October 2012}}</ref> and added considerable solidity at the back for Norwich. Though Norwich hoped to extend the loan, this was not possible, so Taylor returned to Birmingham at the end of the initial month.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/7142214.stm |title=Taylor returns to Birmingham City |publisher=BBC Sport |date=13 December 2007 |accessdate=25 October 2012}}</ref>

Following [[Alex_McLeish|Alex McLeish]]'s arrival as Birmingham manager, Taylor was told that he was surplus to requirements; the club accepted an offer from [[Queens_Park_Rangers|Queens Park Rangers]], reported at £1.25 million, but the player rejected it.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.birminghammail.net/birmingham-sport/birmingham-city-fc/birmingham-city-fc-news/2007/12/14/martin-taylor-rejects-qpr-move-97319-20250829/ |title=Martin Taylor rejects QPR move |work=Birmingham Mail |last=Tattum |first=Colin |date=14 December 2007 |accessdate=19 February 2008}}</ref> However, injury to [[Rafael_Schmitz|Rafael Schmitz]], Jaïdi's absence on international duty and McLeish's failure to sign any of his defensive targets gave Taylor a first league start of the season in a 1–1 draw with [[Derby_County_F.C.|Derby County]] in January 2008.<ref name=pairings/> He kept his place for the next match despite the availability of Schmitz and Jaïdi, and his impressive form left him in McLeish's plans for the remainder of the season.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.birminghammail.net/birmingham-sport/birmingham-city-fc/birmingham-city-fc-news/2008/02/11/martin-taylor-wins-back-his-birmingham-city-place-97319-20461492/ |title=Martin Taylor wins back his Birmingham City place |work=Birmingham Mail |date=11 February 2008 |accessdate=19 February 2008}}</ref>

;伊度亞度·達施華斷腳事件
On 23 February 2008, in the third minute of Birmingham's home match against [[Arsenal_F.C.|Arsenal]], Taylor committed a foul on [[Croatia_national_football_team|Croatian international]] striker [[Eduardo_da_Silva|Eduardo da Silva]] as a result of which Eduardo suffered a compound fracture to his left [[fibula|fibula]] and an open dislocation of his left ankle. He received treatment on the field for seven minutes before undergoing surgery at a local hospital, and was transferred to a London hospital the following day.<ref name=bbcinjury>{{cite news

At president [[Sepp_Blatter|Sepp Blatter]]'s personal request, [[FIFA|FIFA]]'s disciplinary chairman reviewed the matter, suggesting that [[the_Football_Association|the Football Association]] increase Taylor's punishment from the standard three-match ban; they refused to do so as there was no suggestion of intent.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/7300439.stm |title=Taylor makes Birmingham comeback |publisher=BBC Sport |date=18 March 2008 |accessdate=20 March 2008}}</ref>
