馬里蘭與賓夕法尼亞鐵路（Maryland and Pennsylvania Railroad，常被簡稱為「Ma and Pa」），是位於美國[[賓夕法尼亞州|賓夕法尼亞州]][[約克縣_(賓夕法尼亞州)|約克郡]]與[[:en:Hanover,_Pennsylvania|漢諾瓦]]之間的鐵路，於1901年到1950年代之間，其客運與貨運營運範圍為約克與巴爾的摩之間。在1930年代與1940年代之間，馬里蘭與賓夕法尼亞鐵路以其古老的設備以及行經馬里蘭與賓夕法尼亞兩州之山丘鄉野間的蜿蜒路線，於鐵道愛好者中享有盛名。馬里蘭與賓夕法尼亞鐵路於約克至巴爾的摩之間的路線長為 {{convert|77.2|mi|km|0}}（兩地之間直線距離僅有 {{convert|45|mi|km|0}}），反映出本鐵路本為兩條窄軌距鐵路不經意合併所成的歷史。<ref name=Moed>{{cite book|author=Frank P.

馬里蘭與賓夕法尼亞鐵路的客運服務於1954年8月31日停止，從巴爾的摩至馬里蘭－賓夕法尼亞州州界以南的的路線在1958年6月廢棄。到了1984年，其餘的原始路線大多也已廢棄。馬里蘭與賓夕法尼亞鐵路在1980年代取得原[[賓夕法尼亞鐵路|賓夕法尼亞鐵路]]於約克至漢諾瓦之間長{{convert|19|mi|km|0|adj=on}}的路線，現由[[:en:York_Railway|約克鐵路]]營運。<ref name=MaPaHist>{{cite web|author=Craig Sansonetti|title=A History of the Maryland & Pennsylvania Railroad|date=1997-06-05|publisher=Maryland and Pennsylvania Railroad Preservation Society|url=http://www.maandparailroad.com/mapahistory.html |accessdate=2008-05-25 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20051230233324/http://www.maandparailroad.com/mapahistory.html |archivedate = December 30, 2005}}</ref>

==歷史==

===十九世紀的前身===
馬里蘭與賓夕法尼亞鐵路的前身是19世紀的兩個窄軌距（3英尺，合 914 mm）鐵路－－巴爾的摩與德爾他鐵路（Baltimore & Delta Railway，後改稱巴爾的摩與李海鐵路（Baltimore & Lehigh Railway）），以及[[:en:York_and_Peach_Bottom_Railway|約克與皮曲巴頓鐵路]]（York and Peach Bottom Railway，後改稱約克南方鐵路（York Southern Railroad）。<ref name=Hilton>{{cite book|author=George W. Hilton|title=The Ma & Pa — A History of the Maryland & Pennsylvania Railroad|publisher=Howell-North Books|location=Berkeley, CA |year=1963|lccn=63017444}}</ref>{{rp|61}}

巴爾的摩與德爾他鐵路的建築始於1881年，於1882年4月17日開始[[巴爾的摩|巴爾的摩]]至[[陶森|陶森]]的客運服務。1882年稍後該公司併入[[:en:Maryland_Central_Railroad|馬里蘭中央鐵路]]。其路線於1883年6月21日向北延伸至[[貝萊爾_(馬里蘭州)|貝萊爾]]，<ref name=Hilton />{{rp|22}}並於1884年1月延伸至賓夕法尼亞州的[[:en:Delta,_Pennsylvania|德爾他]]，全線完工。

[[File:Abutments_of_overpass_of_Ma_and_Pa_Railroad_on_York_Road,_Towson,_MD.jpg|thumb]]

賓夕法尼亞州的皮曲巴頓鐵路（Peach Bottom Railway）公司於1871年成立。該公司的窄軌鐵路路線中段－－約克至[[:en:Red_Lion,_Pennsylvania|雷德萊恩]]－－於1874年開通，向南至德爾他的路線於1876年完工。<ref name=Hilton />{{rp|11}}不過公司在1881年破產，於1882年重組為[[:en:York_and_Peach_Bottom_Railway|約克與皮曲巴頓鐵路]]。該公司與馬里蘭中央鐵路於1891年合併為巴爾的摩與李海鐵路（Baltimore and Lehigh Railroad Company），合併後新公司的列車行駛於約克至巴爾的摩之間。不過到了1893年由於財務問題，該公司再度分割為巴爾的摩與李海鐵路（'''Baltimore and Lehigh Railway Company'''）以及約克南方鐵路（York Southern Railroad）。<ref>http://www.maparailroadhist.org/history.htm</ref>

兩家鐵路公司在1890年代都掙扎於貨運運量低下與財務困難。由於其路線為窄軌，兩家公司的車廂都不能與其他公司的路線交流。<ref name=Moed />終於在1898年到1900年之間，兩家公司的路線都改為標準軌距，並於1901年2月12日合併為馬里蘭與賓夕法尼亞鐵路（ Maryland and Pennsylvania Railroad）。<ref name=Hilton />拓寬以後馬里蘭與賓夕法尼亞鐵路在巴爾的摩與約克之間的蜿蜒路線長為{{convert|77.2|mi|km|0|adj=on}}；相較之下，與其競爭的[[賓夕法尼亞鐵路|賓夕法尼亞鐵路]]的[[北方中央鐵路|北方中央鐵路]]路線，巴爾的摩到約克之間的長度僅為{{convert|56|mi|km|0|adj=on}}。<ref name=Moed />馬里蘭與賓夕法尼亞鐵路路線的坡度最大高達2.3%，並有55個16到20度之間的急彎（大多數的鐵路幹線轉彎不超過6度，即使是行經洛磯山脈的[[:en:Denver_and_Rio_Grande_Western_Railroad|丹佛與里歐格蘭德西方鐵路]]，其幹線轉彎也不超過20度。）<ref name=Moed />

===20th century===
[[File:Red_Lion,_Pennsylvania.jpg|thumb]]
Following the merger, the Ma and Pa operated through passenger and freight trains between York and Baltimore, as well as local trains at each end of the line, hauling mail and express, [[slate|slate]], [[marble|marble]], [[Anthracite|anthracite coal]], lumber, furniture, and agricultural products to market.<ref name=Moed /> Particularly on the Pennsylvania Division (Delta–York), slate from Delta and manufactured goods from Red Lion and York were mainstays of the railroad's outbound freight traffic in the early years. On the Maryland Division, inbound anthracite coal deliveries accounted for a significant volume of carloadings, along with milk from the many dairy farms in the area.<ref name=Hilton />{{rp|83}}<ref name=Times03>{{cite news |last=Allen |first=Bob |title=Recalling the little engine that could |work=The Towson Times|date=October 15, 2003 |page=34}}</ref> One early morning train from [[Fallston,_Maryland|Fallston]] boarded more than 1,100 gallons of milk daily and was dubbed the "Milky Way".<ref name=Times03 /> The line was profitable and traffic volume was such that additional locomotives were necessary.

The next year, three [[2-8-0|2-8-0]] "Consolidations" by Baldwin were added to the roster, providing more powerful locomotives for the Baltimore–York through freights.<ref name=Hilton />{{rp|87}} At its peak, the railroad had 16 locomotives and 160 pieces of rolling stock, with 573 employees.<ref name=lion>{{cite web|title=The Red Lion Train Station History|date=2007-06-25|publisher=Red Lion (Pa.)

[[File:Ma_and_Pa_RR_timetable.jpg|thumb]]
With increasing competition from trucks and automobiles in the 1920s, passenger volume began to decline along with [[less-than-carload|less-than-carload]] freight, such as milk from the many dairy farms along the Ma and Pa's pastoral route. The Ma and Pa substituted more economical, self-propelled gas-electric passenger cars for steam-powered passenger trains in 1927–1928. Carload freight volume increased in the 1920s, however, as more industries located along the line, and earnings were strong enough for the company to declare dividends in 1930 and 1931.<ref name=Hilton />{{rp|111}} The Ma and Pa's relative prosperity ended with the economic downturn during the [[Great_Depression|Great Depression]], which cut the railroad's gross revenues by half from 1932 to 1935.<ref name=Hilton />{{rp|114}}

In the mid-1930s, the Ma and Pa became an early favorite of railfans, attracted by its hilly, curving line through rural Maryland and Pennsylvania. The railroad offered several popular fan excursions pulled by its elderly steam locomotives.<ref>{{cite web|author=Herbert H. Harwood, Jr.|title=Maryland & Pennsylvania Railroad: The 'Ma & Pa'|date=2004–2005|publisher=Maryland Online Encyclopedia|url=http://www.mdoe.org/md_penn_railroad.html |accessdate=2008-07-07 }}{{Dead link|date=May 2012}}</ref>

Following the end of [[World_War_II|World War II]], the Ma and Pa acquired four [[diesel_locomotive|diesel locomotive]]s for more economical operations, but traffic declined significantly. When the Ma and Pa's mail contract was cancelled by the U.S. postal service, the railroad discontinued all passenger service on August 31, 1954.<ref name=Hilton />{{rp|141}} One person on the last passenger train recalled that many riders came from as far away as [[Boston,_Massachusetts|Boston, Massachusetts]], and [[Washington,_D.C.|Washington, D.C.]], to participate in the historic event, along with members of the [[National_Railway_Historical_Society|National Railway Historical Society]].<ref>{{cite news|author=John R.

[[File:Ma_&_Pa_RR_at_Towson.jpg|thumb]], on June 11, 1958]]
The lack of traffic on the railroad's {{convert|44|mi|km|adj=on}} Baltimore–Whiteford Maryland Division in the 1950s was particularly acute. One of the last major shipments to occur was [[Indiana_Limestone|Indiana limestone]] for the construction of Baltimore's [[Cathedral_of_Mary_Our_Queen|Cathedral of Mary Our Queen]] in 1956.<ref name=Hilton />{{rp|151}} The Baltimore–Whiteford segment in Maryland was finally abandoned altogether on June 11, 1958, leaving only the stone abutments where the tracks crossed [[Maryland_Route_45|York Road]] in Towson on a steel girder bridge. A local group of history buffs placed a bronze plaque on the west abutment in 1999, commemorating the departed railroad's place in Towson history.<ref>{{cite news|author=Loni Ingraham|title='Ma and Pa' railroad abutments get HTI plaque|publisher=''The Towson Times''|date=May 26, 1999}}</ref>

In the 1960s, the Ma and Pa Railroad continued to solicit business along its line for its remaining {{convert|34.8|mi|km|1|adj=on}} Whiteford–York segment, almost entirely in Pennsylvania. In 1964, it added a siding {{convert|905|ft|m|0}} long near Red Lion to serve a new cigar box factory.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Paul Kulishek|date=Spring 2008|title=White Flag Extra|journal=Timetable|publisher=Maryland and Pennsylvania Railroad Historical Society|volume= 23|issue= 2|pages=16}}</ref> In 1971, the Maryland and Pennsylvania Railroad was acquired by Emons Industries.<ref name=HistSoc>{{cite web |title=About the Maryland and Pennsylvania Railroad |publisher=The Maryland and Pennsylvania Railroad Historical Society |date=2008-01-25 |url=http://www.maparailroadhist.org/history.htm |accessdate=2008-05-30 }}</ref> Primarily hauling slate from a [[quarry|quarry]] at Delta, and furniture from a factory in Red Lion, the Ma and Pa's Pennsylvania Division continued in operation until June 14, 1978, when the line was further reduced to the {{convert|9|mi|km|0|adj=on}} York–Red Lion section.<ref name=lion /> The Red Lion freight station was closed on November 1, 1980;  when the Pennsylvania town's furniture manufacturer shuttered its doors in 1984, the Red Lion section of the railroad was also abandoned.<ref name=MaPaHist /><ref name=lion />
