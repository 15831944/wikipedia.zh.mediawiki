:Oh, I wish I was in the land of cotton,
:Old times there are not forgotten.
:Look away, look away, look away Dixie Land!

:In Dixie's Land, where I was born in,
:early on one frosty mornin'.
:Look away, look away, look away Dixie Land!

:I wish I was in Dixie, Hooray! Hooray!
:In Dixie's Land I'll take my stand,
:to live and die in Dixie.
:Away, away, away down south in Dixie!
:Away, away, away down south in Dixie!

:There's buckwheat cakes and Injun batter,
:Makes you fat or a little fatter.
:Look away! Look away! Look away! Dixie Land

:Then hoe it down and scratch your gravel,
:To Dixie's Land I'm bound to travel.
:Look away! Look away! Look away! Dixie Land

:I wish I was in Dixie, Hooray! Hooray!
:In Dixie's Land I'll take my stand,
:to live and die in Dixie.
:Away, away, away down south in Dixie!
:Away, away, away down south in Dixie!<ref>Nathan 362–4.</ref>
