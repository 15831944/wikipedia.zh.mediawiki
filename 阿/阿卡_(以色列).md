'''阿卡'''（{{lang-he-n|עַכּוֹ}}，{{lang-ar|عكّا}}，{{lang-en|Acre}}）是一座位于[[以色列|以色列]]北部[[加利利|加利利]]西部的城市，距离[[耶路撒冷|耶路撒冷]]约152公里。阿卡是持续有人类居住的最古老的城市之一。2011年人口为46,464人<ref name="cbs-loc">{{cite web|title=Locality File|year=2011|url=http://cbs.gov.il/ishuvim/ishuv2011/bycode.xls|publisher=[[Israel_Central_Bureau_of_Statistics|Israel Central Bureau of Statistics]]|format=XLS|accessdate=February 2, 2013}}</ref>，约75%为犹太人，25%为阿拉伯人。在1948年被以色列占领之前，大多数阿卡居民是阿拉伯人。

<!--（[[Greek_language|Greek]]: Αντιόχεια της Πτολεμαΐδος）, city names</sup> is in the Western [[Galilee|Galilee]] district。 

It stands on a low promontory at the northern extremity of the [[Bay_of_Acre|Bay of Acre]], 152 kilometers (95 miles) N.N.W. from [[Jerusalem|Jerusalem]]. 

It was long regarded as the "Key of [[Palestine_(region)|Palestine]]," on account of its commanding position on the shore of the broad coastal plain that joins the inland plain of [[Esdraelon|Esdraelon]], and so affords the easiest entrance to the interior of the country.

阿卡古城e has been designated by [[UNESCO|UNESCO]] as a [[World_Heritage_Site|World Heritage Site]] and contains, among other sites, a tunnel leading to a 13世纪fortress of the [[Knights_Templar|Knights Templar]].

Since the [[1990s|1990s]], there are vast works of archeological excavations and preservations of ancient structures in progress. The works are carried out by the [[Old_Acre_Development_Company|Old Acre Development Company]]（OADC）。

=== 城墙 ===
In 1750, [[Daher_El-Omar|Daher El-Omar]], the ruler of Acre, utilized the remnants of [[十字军|十字军]]walls as a foundation for his walls. They were reinforced between 1775 and 1799 by [[Jezzar_Pasha|Jezzar Pasha]] and survived [[Napoleon|Napoleon]]'s siege. The wall was thin: its height was 10 to 13 metres (33 to 43 feet) and its thickness only one metre (3 feet).

A heavy land [[defense_wall|defense wall]] was built north and east to the city in 1800-1814 by [[Jezzar_Pasha|Jezzar Pasha]]（called by the locals '''Al-Jezzar'''）and his Jewish advisor [[Haim_Farkhi|Haim Farkhi]]. This wall is the first notable thing to come into sight when coming to Acre. It is a modern [[counter_artillery|counter artillery]] [[fortification|fortification]] which includes a thick [[defensive_wall|defensive wall]], a dry [[moat|moat]], [[cannon|cannon]] outposts and three ''Burges''（large defensive [[tower|tower]]s）。

The sea wall, which remains mostly complete, is the original El-Omar's wall that was reinforced by al-Jezzar.

The Al Jezzar [[mosque|mosque]] was built by [[Jezzar_Pasha|Jezzar Pasha]]（d. 1804）from materials taken from [[Caesarea_Maritima|Caesarea Maritima]]: his tomb is within.

=== Hamam al Basha ===
[[Hamam|Hamam]] is a hot [[Turkey|Turkish]] [[public_bathing|bath]]. Acre's Hamam is notable mainly because it was used by the [[Irgun|Irgun]] as a bridge to break into the citadel's prison.

=== The Citadel ===
The current building which consists the citadel of Acre is an [[Ottoman_Empire|Ottoman]] fortification, built on the foundation of the [[Hospitallers_of_St_John_of_Jerusalem|Hospitallerian citadel]]. The citadel was part of the city's defensive formation, reinforcing the northern wall.

During the 20th century the citadel was used mainly as a [[prison|prison]] and as the site for a [[gallows|gallows]]. During the [[British_mandate|British mandate]] period, activists of Jewish Zionist resistance movements were held prisoner there; some were executed there. In 1947, members of the [[Irgun|Irgun]] broke into the citadel and released many prisoners.

Today, the citadel of Acre contains the following:
* The Ottoman fortifications (including the tower and the moat).
* Acre Old City Visitor Centers.
* The "enchanted garden": a new garden that is planted according to historical description of the garden that was there during the [[Crusades|Crusades]] period.
* Acre's British prison and the gallows.
* Memorial for Jewish resistance fighters executed during the British mandate.
* A Museum for the Jewish resistance prisoners, מוזיאון אסירי המחתרות .
* Prison cell of [[Bahá'u'lláh|Bahá'u'lláh]], Founder of the [[Bahá'í_Faith|Bahá'í Faith]].
* Knights' Halls (see below).

[[As_of_2004|As of August 2004]], the citadel is partly closed due to preservation work.

=== The Knights' Halls ===
Under the [[citadel|citadel]] and prison of Acre, [[archeology|archeological]] excavations revealed a complex of halls, which was built and used by the [[Hospitallers_of_St_John_of_Jerusalem|Hospitallers Knights]]. This complex was a part of the Hospitallers' [[citadel|citadel]], which was combined in the northern [[wall|wall]] of Acre.

The complex includes:
* Six semi-joint halls.
* One large hall, recently excavated.
* Dungeon.
* Dining room (with a tunnel).
* Posta and Crypta (remains of an ancient Gothic church).

（Those interested in medieval European remains should also visit the Church of Saint George and adjacent houses at the Genovese Square （called Kikar ha-Genovezim or Kikar Genoa in Hebrew）. There were also residential quarters and marketplaces run by merchants from Pisa and Amalfi in Crusader and medieval Acre, so today there are also Pisa and Amalfi Squares in the old city.)

=== Bahá'í holy places ===
[[File:Bahji-Santuari2.jpg|thumb]] where Bahá'u'lláh is buried.]]

There are many [[Bahá'í_Faith|Bahá'í]] holy places in and around Acre.  They originate from [[Bahá'u'lláh|Bahá'u'lláh's]] imprisonment [[Bahá'í_World_Centre_buildings#Prison_cell_of_Bahá'u'lláh|in the Citadel]] during Ottoman Rule.  The final years of Bahá'u'lláh's life were spent in the [[Mansion_of_Bahjí|Mansion of Bahjí]], just outside Acre, even though he was still formally a prisoner of the Ottoman Empire. 

Bahá'u'lláh died on [[May_29|May 29]] [[1892|1892]] in Bahjí, and his [[Shrine_of_Bahá'u'lláh|shrine]] is the most holy place for Bahá'ís—their [[Qiblih|Qiblih]], the location that Bahá'ís should face when saying their daily obligatory prayers. It contains the remains of Bahá'u'lláh and is near the spot where he died in the Mansion of Bahjí.

Other Bahá'í holy places in Acre include the [[Bahá'í_World_Centre_buildings#House_of_`Abbúd|House of `Abbúd]]（where Bahá'u'lláh and his family resided）and the [[Bahá'í_World_Centre_buildings#House_of_`Abdu'lláh_Páshá|House of `Abdu'lláh Páshá]]（where later 'Abdu'l-Bahá resided with his family）, and the [[Bahá'í_World_Centre_buildings#The_Garden_of_Ridván|Garden of Ridván]] where Bahá'u'lláh enjoyed spending the later part of his life.

==历史==
Few towns have had a more chequered or calamitous history.  Of great antiquity, Acre is probably to be identified with the Aak of the tribute-lists of [[Thutmoses_III|Thutmoses III]]（c. 1500 B.C.）, and it is certainly the Akka of the [[Amarna_letters|Amarna letters]].  To the [[Israelites|Hebrews]] it was known as Akko, but it is mentioned only once in the [[Old_Testament|Old Testament]], namely [[Book_of_Judges|Judges]] 1:31, as one of the places from which the Israelites did not drive out the [[Canaan|Canaan]]ite inhabitants.  Theoretically it was in the territory of the tribe of [[Asher|Asher]], and [[Josephus|Josephus]] assigns it by name to the district of one of [[Solomon|Solomon]]'s provincial governors.  Throughout the period of Hebrew domination, however, its political connections were always with [[Syria|Syria]] rather than with the [[Philistines|Philistines]]: thus, about [[725_BC|725 BC]] it joined [[Sidon|Sidon]] and [[Tyre_(Lebanon)|Tyre]] in a revolt against [[Shalmaneser_V|Shalmaneser V]]. It had a stormy experience during the three centuries preceding the [[Christianity|Christian]] era. 

=== The Greek and Roman periods = ==

The [[Greece|Greek]] historians name it Ake (Josephus calls it also Akre); but the name was changed to Antiochia Ptolemais shortly after [[Alexander_the_Great|Alexander the Great]]'s conquest, and then to Ptolemais, probably by [[Ptolemaic_dynasty|Ptolemy Soter]], after the partition of the kingdom of [[Alexander_the_Great|Alexander the Great]]. [http://www.bibleplaces.com/acco.htm]

[[Strabo|Strabo]] refers to the city as once a rendezvous for the [[Persian_Empire|Persians]] in their expeditions against [[Egypt|Egypt]].  About [[165_BC|165 BC]] [[Simon_Maccabaeus|Simon Maccabaeus]] defeated the Syrians in many battles in [[Galilee|Galilee]], and drove them into Ptolemais.  About [[153_BC|153 BC]] [[Alexander_Balas|Alexander Balas]], son of [[Antiochus_Epiphanes|Antiochus Epiphanes]], contesting the Syrian crown with [[Demetrius|Demetrius]], seized the city, which opened its gates to him.  Demetrius offered many bribes to the [[Maccabees|Maccabees]] to obtain [[Jew|Jew]]ish support against his rival, including the revenues of Ptolemais for the benefit of the [[Temple_in_Jerusalem|Temple in Jerusalem]], but in vain.  [[Jonathan|Jonathan]] threw in his lot with Alexander, and in [[150_BC|150 BC]] he was received by him with great honour in
Ptolemais.  Some years later, however, Tryphon, an officer of the Syrians, who had grown suspicious of the Maccabees, enticed Jonathan into Ptolemais and there treacherously took him prisoner. 

The city was also assaulted and captured by [[Alexander_Jannaeus|Alexander Jannaeus]], by [[Cleopatra_VII_of_Egypt|Cleopatra VII of Egypt]] and by [[Tigranes_II_of_Armenia|Tigranes II of Armenia]].  Here [[Herod|Herod]] built a [[gymnasium_(ancient_Greece)|gymnasium]], and here the Jews met [[Petronius|Petronius]], sent to set up statues of the emperor in the [[Temple|Temple]], and persuaded him to turn back.  [[Paul_of_Tarsus|St Paul]] spent a day in Ptolemais（Acts 21:7）. A Roman [[colonia|colonia]] was established at the city, Colonia Claudii Cæsaris. [http://www.ancientlibrary.com/gazetteer/0006.html]

=== Arab rule and the Crusades ===
The [[Arabs|Arabs]] captured the city in AD 638, and held it until they lost it to the [[Crusade|crusaders]] in 1104.  The latter made the town their chief port in Palestine.  It was re-taken by [[Saladin|Saladin]] in 1187, besieged by [[Guy_of_Lusignan|Guy of Lusignan]] in 1189 at the [[Siege_of_Acre|Siege of Acre]], and again captured by [[Richard_I_of_England|Richard the Lionheart]] in 1191.  It then became the capital of the remnant of the [[Kingdom_of_Jerusalem|Kingdom of Jerusalem]].  In 1229 it was placed under the control of the [[Knights_Hospitaller|Knights Hospitaller]]（whence came one of its alternative names）.  It was the final stronghold of the Crusader state, and fell to [[Siege_of_Acre_(1291)|a bloody siege]] to the [[Mameluks|Mameluks]] in 1291.  The [[Ottoman_Empire|Ottomans]] under Sultan [[Selim_I|Selim I]] captured the city in 1517, after which it fell into almost total decay.  [[Maundrell|Maundrell]] in 1697 found it a complete ruin, save for a khan (caravanserai) occupied by some French merchants, a [[mosque|mosque]] and a few poor
cottages.

（The Crusaders called the city "Acre" or "Saint-Jean d'Acre" since they mistakenly identified it with the Philistine city of Ekron, in southern Israel （Tel Miqne-Ekron）. Josephus' mention of "Akre" should be checked to see exactly which city he was referring to.)

=== Ottoman rule ===
Towards the end of the 18th century it revived under the rule of [[Daher_El-Omar|Daher El-Omar]], the local sheikh: his successor, [[Jezzar_Pasha|Jezzar Pasha]], governor of [[Damascus|Damascus]], improved and fortified it, but by heavy imposts secured for himself all the benefits derived from his improvements.  About 1780 Jezzar peremptorily banished the French trading colony, in spite of protests from the French government, and refused to receive a consul. 

In 1799 [[Napoleon|Napoleon]], in pursuance of his scheme for raising a Syrian rebellion against Turkish domination, appeared before Acre, but after a siege of two months (March--May) was repulsed by the Turks, aided by Sir [[Sidney_Smith_(admiral)|Sidney Smith]] and a force of British sailors. Having lost his siege cannons to Smith, [[Napoleon|Napoleon]] attempted to lay siege to the  walled city defended by Ottoman troops on 20 March 1799, using only his infantry and small-caliber cannons, a strategy which failed, leading to his retreat two months later on [[May_21|May 21]].

Jezzar was succeeded on his death by his son Suleiman, under whose milder rule the town advanced in prosperity till 1831, when [[Ibrahim_Pasha|Ibrahim Pasha]] besieged and reduced the town and destroyed its buildings.  On [[November_4|November 4]], [[1840|1840]] it was bombarded by the allied British, [[Austria|Austria]]n and French squadrons, and in the following year restored to Turkish rule.

=== The British Mandate ===
The [[citadel|citadel]] of Acre was used by the British as a [[prison|prison]] mainly for political prisoners, and as a location for a [[gallows|gallows]]. Jewish underground movement activists, such as [[Zeev_Jabotinsky|Zeev Jabotinsky]] and [[Shlomo_Ben-Yosef|Shlomo Ben-Yosef]], an [[Irgun|Irgun]] activist, were jailed in the citadel-prison of Acre. Ben-Yosef was the first Jew to be executed under the British mandate.
According to the first census afte the British rule over Acre, the province's population was 100,000 inhabitants, most of who were Shiite Turks, Turkmen, Azeris, Persians, Bosnians, Albanians, and Circassians, and Greeks. it included modern cities of Sidon, Tyre, Nabatiye, Nahariye, and some other inner villages and towns such as Ummi Faraj, Mazraa, Dir Qasi...etc.

On [[May_4|May 4]], [[1947|1947]], the [[Irgun|Irgun]] broke into the Acre citadel prison in order to release Jewish activists imprisoned there by the British. Some 255 inmates escaped, the majority Arab [http://www.britains-smallwars.com/Palestine/Acre.htm]. Twenty-seven prisoners from armed Jewish groups escaped (20 from [[Irgun|Irgun]], seven from [[Lehi_(group)|Lehi]]). In the immediate aftermath of the raid, nine were killed, five attackers and eight escapees were captured.

Despite the heavy toll in human lives, the action was described by foreign journalists as "the greatest jail break in history." The London [[Ha'aretz|Ha'aretz]] correspondent wrote on [[May_5|May 5]]:
:"The attack on Acre jail has been seen here as a serious blow to British prestige... Military circles described the attack as a strategic masterpiece." 
The [[New_York_Herald_Tribune|New York Herald Tribune]] wrote that the underground had carried out "an ambitious mission, their most challenging so far, in perfect fashion."
Of the five captured attackers, three who had been carrying weapons were tried and sentenced to death; the other two, minors who were unarmed when captured, received [[life_sentence|life sentence]]s.

=== Israeli rule ===
Acre fell under territory assigned by the [[1947_UN_Partition_Plan|1947 UN Partition Plan]] to a future Arab State in Palestine. The plan was rejected by the Palestinian Arabs. The town was captured by the Jewish [[Haganah|Haganah]] on [[May_17|May 17]], [[1948|1948]], during the [[1948_Arab-Israeli_War|1948 Arab-Israeli War]]. About three-fourths of its Arab population（1944 est. pop. 13,000）fled from the city during this time. 

The old city of Akko has been designated by [[UNESCO|UNESCO]] as a World Heritage Site and contains a tunnel leading to a 13th century fortress of the Knights Templar. Since the 1990s, there are vast works of archeological excavations and preservations of ancient structures in progress. Akko has one of the higher proportions of non-Jews of any of Israel's cities, including roughly 45 percent Christians, Muslims, [[Druze|Druze]] and [[Bahá'í_Faith|Bahá'ís]]. The city is a magnet for tourists and the home of the country's steel industry. It also produces exports including iron, chemicals, and textiles.

== Transportation In Acre ==
===Bus===
Acre has a central bus station that is served by [[Egged_Bus_Cooperative|Egged]] buses. Services include fairly modest internal service and relatively extensive inter-city service. Due to its strategic location, Acre central bus station has bus links to major cities and towns as [[Haifa|Haifa]], [[Nahariya|Nahariya]], [[Karmiel|Karmiel]], [[Zefat|Zefat]], [[Kiryat_Shmona|Kiryat Shmona]], [[Sakhnin|Sakhnin]], as well as lines connecting it to nearby smaller villages.

===Rail===
Akko (Acre) is served by the [[Akko_Railway_Station|Akko Railway Station]]
