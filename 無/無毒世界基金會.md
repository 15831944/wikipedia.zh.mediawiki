無毒世界基金會的主要活動在於推出有爭議性的「毒品的真相」系列小冊子及「真人真事紀錄片」，影片關於氾濫毒品如海洛因、大麻、古柯鹼、安非他命等毒品藥物，該基金會也提到處方藥、酒精等藥物。

批評者指責基金會舉辦反毒活動時並不披露與山達基教會和[[那可拿|那可拿]]戒毒中心（[[新生活教育中心|新生活教育中心]]）的關係，而反毒資料中有不受醫學、科學社羣支持的內容，最著名的是「小量毒品會提神，所有毒品都一樣」。

山達基以及其附屬組織（以下簡稱本組織）宣稱主流的醫學對於本組織的「偏方」存有偏見，因此那些「鼓吹用藥的醫學專家學者無法相信本組織能提供一種不需服藥就能治百病的療法。」<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/education/article/SAN-FRANCISCO-Church-s-drug-program-flunks-S-F-2720851.php|title=SAN FRANCISCO / Church's drug program flunks S.F. test / Panel of experts finds Scientology's Narconon lectures outdated, inaccurate|newspaper=SFGate|access-date=2016-11-21}}</ref>

In 1991, Time called Scientology's anti-drug program "Narconon" a "vehicle for drawing addicts into the cult" - which the magazine said "invented hundreds of goods and services for which members are urged to give up 'donations' " - such as $1,250 for advice on "moving swiftly up the Bridge" of enlightenment. That's New Age techno-gobbledygook for advice on buying swiftly up the Bridge of Brooklyn. Scientology fronts such as the New York Rescue Workers Detoxification Project - its Web site immediately recognizable as the work of Hubbardites by its logo, which looks like the cover of a Robert Heinlein paperback from 1971 - hint that their gimmicks might possibly interest anyone dreaming of weight loss, higher I.Q. or freedom from addiction.

Drug addicts are just one of the Scientologists’ targets for recruitment. The offer of care and healing through techniques derived from dianetics is only a come-on. The detoxification of the patient by means of “dianetics purification” is more a matter of manipulation, through the general weakening that it causes; it is a way of brainwashing the subject. Frequently convicted for illegal practice of medicine, violence, fraud and slander, the Scientologists have more and more trouble getting people to accept their techniques as effective health measures, as they like to claim. They recommend their purification processes to eliminate X-rays and nuclear radiation, and to treat goiter and warts, hypertension and psoriasis, hemorrhoids and myopia. . . why would anyone find that hard to swallow? Scientology has built a library of several hundreds of volumes of writings exalting the effects of purification, and its disciples spew propaganda based on irresponsible medical writings by doctors who are more interested in the support provided by Scientology than in their patients’ well-being. On the other hand, responsible scientific reviews have long since “eliminated” dianetics and purification from the lists of therapies — relegating them to the great bazaar of medical fraud. ... Medical charlatans do not base their claims on scientific proof but, quite to the contrary, on peremptory assertions — the kind of assertions that they challenge when they come out of the mouths of those who defend “real” medicine. }}</ref>」，

In his letter to Trish Bascom, director of health programs for the San Francisco Unified School District, Heilig said five independent experts in the field of drug abuse had helped him evaluate Narconon's curriculum. ... "One of our reviewers opined that 'this (curriculum) reads like a high school science paper pieced together from the Internet, and not very well at that,' " Heilig wrote Bascom. "Another wrote that 'my comments will be brief, as this proposal hardly merits detailed analysis.' Another stated, 'As a parent, I would not want my child to participate in this kind of 'education.' " Heilig's team evaluated Narconon against a recent study by Rodney Skager, a professor emeritus at UCLA's Graduate School of Education and Information Studies, describing what good anti-drug programs should offer students. "We concurred that ... the Narconon materials focus on some topics of lesser importance to the exclusion of best knowledge and practices," Heilig wrote, and that the curriculum contained "factual errors in basic concepts such as physical and mental effects, addiction and even spelling."|accessdate=7 September 2012}}</ref>
