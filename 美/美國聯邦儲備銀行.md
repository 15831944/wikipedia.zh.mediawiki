'''美國聯邦儲備銀行'''（{{lang-en|'''Federal Reserve Bank'''}}）是[[美國|美國]]的[[中央銀行|中央銀行]]體系「[[联邦储备系统|联邦储备系统]]」的運作分支，共12個，每個銀行分管自己的聯邦準備轄區，各銀行股份為公私混合，非完全政府所有。

==簡史==
聯邦儲備銀行乃於1914年11月由[[美國眾議院|美國眾議院]]所通過成立，以協助聯準會監理銀行與金融。

此相關建議最初由美國第一任財政部長[[亚历山大·汉密尔顿|亚历山大·汉密尔顿]]所提出，他後來推動創立了[[中央銀行|中央銀行]]-{制}-度。由於他的努力，美國於1791年成立了第一家國家[[銀行|銀行]]，總部設於當時的第一大城－[[費城|費城]]，並於其他主要城市設置分行。起初在接受民眾存款、發行法定貨幣、開放借貸、購買證券等方面，執行著基本的銀行功能。當時，這些分布於各地方的分行猶如民營企業，在管理權與「所有權」上，有些許混淆。<ref>"The Founding of the Fed." FEDERAL RESERVE BANK of NEW YORK. 24 Mar. 2009 <http://www.newyorkfed.org/>.</ref>

20世紀的美國已晉升為世界工業大國；在國際金融方面，日益扮演著吃重的角色。因此美國國會於1913年通過了《聯邦儲備法案》，使之在執行中央銀行任務上的金融管理與彈性政府功能上得以法制化。此法案明定此「美國中央銀行」的職能、7位董事的設置、分行數量的限制、要求全美各銀行皆須加入此體系的規範，並確定了聯準會主席即聯邦儲備銀行最高長官（中央銀行總裁）的權責。1914年11月，美國於國會正式成立聯邦儲備銀行，允許於彈性供應[[貨幣|貨幣]]及公共需求的原則上，發行美鈔，協助聯準會和白宮推動政令。

{{Main|Criticism of the Federal Reserve}}
The Federal Reserve is often criticized by both political parties and economists. Early on, Hamilton was the creator and only true supporter of the Bank of the United States. His main critics were Thomas Jefferson and James Madison. There was a mass of controversy surrounding the constitutionality of the central banking system. 
<blockquote>
“That is a lie - most importantly their opposition was not so much political as ideological; they vehemently opposed the bank as unconstitutional and potentially dangerous to republican government. Jefferson and Randolph pressed the president to veto the bank bill, and Madison’s vain attempt to galvanize opposition in congress made it obvious where he stood” (Cowen and Wright, 11).
</blockquote>
Hamilton took the arguments of Jefferson and Randolph and quickly made revisions to his bank bill. Within one week Hamilton re-presented the bill and Washington signed it (Cowen and Wright, 11-13). Through this argument, a whole new way of interpreting the constitution came about known as the doctrine of [[implied_powers|implied powers]]. <ref>Cowen, David J. and Robert E. Wright. Financial Founding Fathers. Chicago: Robert E. Wright and David J. Cowen, 2006. </ref>-->

==職權==
<!--
The Bank Bill created by Alexander Hamilton was a proposal to institute a National Bank, in order to improve the economic stability of the nation after her independence from Britain.  Although the bank is used as a tool for the government it is privately owned.  Hamilton wrote several articles providing information regarding his national bank idea.  The articles expressed the validity and "would be" success of the national bank based upon: incentives for rich to invest, ownerships of bonds and shares, rooted in fiscal management, and stable monetary system.  The National Bank, or Federal Reserve Banking System provides the government with a ready source of loans, it is also the safe depository for federal monies. The Federal Reserve is also a low cost mechanism for transferring funds and it is an inexpensive agent for meeting payments on the national debt and government salaries. 

The Federal Reserve Banks issue shares of [[stock|stock]] to member banks. However, owning Federal Reserve Bank stock is quite different from owning stock in a private company. The Federal Reserve Banks are not operated for profit, and ownership of a certain amount of stock is, by law, a condition of membership in the system. The stock may not be sold or traded or pledged as security for a [[loan|loan]]; dividends are, by law, limited to 6 percent per year. [http://minneapolisfed.org/info/sys/faq/frs.cfm#3]

The dividends paid to member banks are considered partial compensation for the lack of interest paid on member banks' required reserves held at the Federal Reserve. By law, banks in the [[United_States|United States]] must maintain fractional reserves, most of which are kept on account at the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve does not pay interest on these funds. (The Federal Reserve now has authority to pay interest on these funds granted by Congress in the EESA of 2008.)

The Federal Reserve Bank of [[New_York_City|New York]] is located only a few blocks from the former location of the [[World_Trade_Center|World Trade Center]] buildings. It has a gold vault 100 feet (30 m) beneath the street. That depository is the largest in the world; even larger than the legendary [[Fort_Knox|Fort Knox]] gold reserves in the mid-1980s.  The gold is owned by foreign nations, including [[Saudi_Arabia|Saudi Arabia]] and [[Kuwait|Kuwait]]. Its value is estimated at $25 billion. Free [http://www.newyorkfed.org/aboutthefed/ny_tours.html tours of the vault] are available to the public.
[[Missouri|Missouri]], [[California|California]] and [[Tennessee|Tennessee]] are the only states which have two Federal Reserve Bank branches seated within their states, with Tennessee having 2 branches of 2 different districts within the same state.
A major responsibility of The Federal Reserve is to oversee their banking and financial systems. Overseeing the banking and financial systems of a bank is crucial in a society. 

<blockquote>
“Confidence in the soundness of the banking and financial systems is what mobilizes a societies savings, allows the savings to be channeled into productive investments, and encourages economic growth” (William J. McDonough, 4)
</blockquote><ref>McDonough, William J. "An Independent Central Bank in a Democratic Country: The Federal Reserve Experience." University of Chicago, Chicago. 22 Apr. 1994.</ref>

Although the original intentions of the Federal Reseve Bank were to improve the economy and financial system today it is suggested that the Federal Reserve has gained too much power over the nations money.<ref>What Happened to Our Money? Preview By: Mcmanus, John F.. New American (08856540), 2/4/2008, Vol. 24 Issue 3, p33-38</ref> In "The Federal Reserve System, Purposes and Functions, Fiftieth Anniversary Edition" the Fed. states that they are the only system with the ability to create and destroy money and thus the ability to control the value of the dollar and the amount in the hands of the public. The Federal Reserve System is a prominent controversy in modern society, but the question still remains, does the Federal Reserve System have a positive or negative influence on the economy? 


There is a lot of speculation and controversy over the issue of monetary control. By constitutional law the [[Bureau_of_Engraving_and_Printing|Bureau of Engraving and Printing]] (BEP, GOV) is the only entity allowed to manufacture, print, or mint US Monies. The Federal Reserve System is the only entity authorized by the US Government to legally destroy currency deemed unfit for circulation. All currency destroyed must be reported to the [[US_Treasury|US Treasury]] so new monies can be produced by the [[Bureau_of_Engraving_and_Printing|Bureau of Engraving and Printing]] to replace that which has been destroyed. The only means in which the Federal Reserve System can create money is by offering banking institutions additional credit on the reserves held by the Federal Reserve System to those financial institutions in need of additional assistance. These “Loans” must be approved by the [[US_Treasury|US Treasury]], therefore leaving the monetary control under Government rulings. The Federal Reserve System operates under very strict guidelines set forth by the [[US_Treasury|US Treasury]], and is subjected to routine audits from government officials operating from the offices of the Treasury.

It is generally considered that the Federal Reserve System is best described as the Commercial Bank's Bank. It supplies the banking industry with very much the same services as the commercial banking industry offers to the public, commercial, and industries, with the exception of not offering interest on the funds stored within their accounts in the Federal Reserve System.-->
