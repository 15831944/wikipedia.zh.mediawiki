=== 早期歷史 ===
[[File:Advertisement_of_American_Express,_1850.png|right]]
美國運通於1850年在[[水牛城_(纽约州)|紐約州水牛城]]成立，最早是由三間不同的快遞公司股份合併組成，分別是[[亨利·威爾斯|亨利·威爾斯]]（Henry Wells & Company）、[[威廉·法格|威廉·法格]]（William Fargo & Company）和[[約翰·巴特菲爾德|約翰·巴特菲爾德]]（John Butterfield）所擁有<ref>[http://firstmention.com/americanexpress.aspx American Express 1850]</ref>。美國運通最初的總部設在曼哈頓翠貝卡（TriBeCa）區的杰街（Jay Street）和哈德遜街（Hudson Street）的交叉口，在紐約州獨佔經營運輸事業（貨物、股票、貨幣等）。1874年美國運通將總部搬遷到紐約州新興的金融區－百老匯（Broadway）65號，其舊址至今仍保留下兩棟建築<ref name="Citycyclopedia">'''Kenneth T. Jackson: ''The Encyclopedia of New York City''''': The New York Historical Society; Yale University Press; 1995. P. 23.</ref>。

==== 美國運通大樓 ====
1854年，美國運通在紐約市維西大街（Vesey Street）一帶購買了大量的不動產。該公司第一間位於紐約的總部設在哈德遜街（Hudson Street）55-61號，為一棟大理石建造的義大利式建築，在一樓有一座十分繁忙的的運輸補給站，屬於哈德遜河鐵路的支線。

在1888年至1890年間的某個時候，[[詹姆士·康德爾·法格|詹姆士·康德爾·法格]]（James Congdell Fargo）在一趟[[歐洲|歐洲]]之行後感到十分洩氣和憤怒。雖然他身為美國運通公司的總裁並攜帶著傳統的[[信用狀|信用狀]]（letter of credit），他發現除了在主要的大城市之外，想要取得現金十分困難。於是法格和馬西魯士·富蘭明·貝瑞（Marcellus Fleming Berry）發明了美國運通[[旅行支票|旅行支票]]（Travelers Cheque），並於1891年以10、20、50和100[[美元|美元]]的面額發行<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,866900-7,00.html Host With The Most], [[時代雜誌|Time Magazine]], 9 April 1956 issue</ref>。

旅行支票的發行讓美國運通成為一間真正的跨國公司。然而這並不是美國運通第一次推行這樣的業務。在1914年[[第一次世界大戰|第一次世界大戰]]爆發時，許多在歐洲的美國人持有來自多間不同銀行發予的信用狀，但大多數的金融機構拒絕提供任何協助，而美國運通歐洲辦公室聯合了其他多間公司，為這些旅行者手中的信用狀提供擔保。

当地时间2008年11月5日，美国运通向[[美国联邦储备委员会|美国联邦储备委员会]]提出转型成为商业银行的申请。11月10日，美国联邦储备委员会批准了这项申请，使得美国运通还可以接收客户存款，以更好的应对由[[次贷危机|次贷危机]]引起的全球金融动荡。美国运通在[[摩根士丹利|摩根士丹利]]和[[高盛集团|高盛集团]]之后，成为在次贷危机中第三家转型成为商业银行的机构组织。<ref>[http://xykol.com/american-express-not-only-creditcard.html 美国运通，不仅只是一个信用卡发卡组织]</ref>

American Express became one of the monopolies that President Theodore Roosevelt had the Interstate Commerce Commission investigate during his administration. The interest of the ICC was drawn to its strict control of the railroad express business. However, the solution did not come immediately to hand.<ref name="Citycyclopedia">'''Kenneth T. Jackson: ''The Encyclopedia of New York City''''': The New York Historical Society; Yale University Press; 1995. P. 23.</ref>. The solution to this problem came as a coincidence to other problems during World War I.

During the winter of [[1917|1917]] the US suffered a severe [[coal|coal]] shortage and on [[December_26|December 26]] [[President_of_the_United_States|President]] [[Woodrow_Wilson|Woodrow Wilson]] commandeered the railroads on behalf of the US government to move [[Military_of_the_United_States|US troops]], their supplies, and coal. [[United_States_Secretary_of_the_Treasury|Treasury Secretary]] [[William_Gibbs_McAdoo|William Gibbs McAdoo]] was assigned the task of consolidating the railway lines for the [[war_effort|war effort]]. All contracts between express companies and railroads were nullified and McAdoo proposed that all existing express companies be consolidated into a single company to serve the country's needs. This ended American Express's express business, and removed them from the ICC’s radar. The result was a new company called the [[Railway_Express_Agency|American Railway Express Agency]] company formed in July [[1918|1918]]. The new entity took custody of all the pooled equipment and property of existing express companies (the largest share of which, 40%, came from American Express, who had owned the rights to the express business over 71,280 miles of railroad lines, and had 10,000 offices, with over 30,000 employees).

=== 旅行部門 ===

美國運通在1915年成立旅行部門（Travel Division），將所有能讓旅行更加輕鬆的服務結合在一起，不久之後他們就成立了集團旗下第一間的旅行社。
<!--
=== 簽帳卡服務歷史 ===
American Express executives discussed the possibility of launching a travel [[charge_card|charge card]] as early as [[1946|1946]], but it was not until [[Diners_Club|Diners Club]] launched their own card in March [[1950|1950]] that American Express began to seriously consider the possibility. At the end of [[1957|1957]] American Express CEO [[Ralph_Reed_(American_Express)|Ralph Reed]] decided to get into the card business, and by the launch date of [[October_1|October 1]], [[1958|1958]] public interest had become so significant that they actually issued 250,000 cards prior to the official launch date. The card was launched with an annual fee of $6, $1 higher than Diners Club, to be seen as a premium product. The first cards were paper, with the account number and cardmember's name typed. It was not until 1959 that American Express began issuing embossed [[ISO_7810|ISO 7810]] plastic cards, an industry first.  

In [[1966|1966]] American Express introduced the [[Gold_Card|Gold Card]] and in [[1984|1984]] the [[Platinum_Card|Platinum Card]], clearly defining different [[market_segment|market segment]]s within its own business, a practice that has proliferated across a broad array of industries. The Platinum Card was billed as super-exclusive and had a $250 annual fee (it is currently $450). It was offered by invitation only to American Express customers with at least 2 years of tenure, significant spending, and excellent payment history. 

In [[1987|1987]], American Express introduced the Optima card, their first [[credit_card|credit card]] product. Previously, all American Express cards had to be paid in full each month, but Optima allowed customers to carry a balance (the charge cards also now allow extended payment options on qualifying charges based on credit availability). Although Optima is no longer heavily promoted, Optima and Optima Platinum cards are still available on the American Express website. Today American Express offers a wide range of other credit cards products including cobranded cards like the JetBlue Card and the Starwood Preferred Guest Card as well as other credit cards promoting customer rewards like the Blue from American Express Card and the Blue Cash Rebate Card. 

In [[1994|1994]], the Optima True Grace card was introduced.  The card was unique in that it offered a [[grace_period|grace period]] on all purchases whether a balance was carried on the card or not (as opposed to traditional revolving credit cards which charge interest on new purchases if so much as $1 was carried over.)  The card was discontinued a few years later; however, the currently-available One from American Express card offers a similar feature called "Interest Protection". 

In [[1999|1999]] American Express introduced the [[Centurion_Card|Centurion Card]] or "black card" catering to an even more affluent and elite customer segment. The card charged a $1,000 annual fee at the time of its introduction (today, it is $2,500) and offered (and continues to offer) a variety of exclusive benefits. There have always been rumors of a super-exclusive card that gives American Express' richest and most powerful customers special perks. It was this rumor that sparked the launch of Centurion.<ref>[http://www.snopes.com/business/bank/blackcard.asp Snopes]</ref> 

Also in 1999, the company introduced Blue from American Express, which quickly became a popular card among [[young_adult|young adult]]s. Based on a successful product for the European market, Blue had no annual fee, a [[Loyalty_program|rewards program]], and a multi-functional onboard chip. A [[Credit_card_cashback|cashback]] version, "Blue Cash", quickly followed. 

American Express also launched an exclusive agreement with [[Costco|Costco]] in 1999, replacing an earlier agreement with [[Discover_Card|Discover Card]]. Under the agreement, American Express cards replaced Discover as the only credit/charge card accepted at the [[warehouse_club|warehouse club]] in the US, and American Express became the first and only credit/charge card accepted at Costco's locations outside the US. To introduce Costco members to American Express, a no-annual-fee co-branded [[Credit_card_cashback|cashback]] credit card was also introduced. The agreement was highly successful and was renewed in 2004 for an additional 10 years.

[[As_of_2005|As of 2005]], the US Centurion card has a $2500 annual fee, while other American Express cards range between no annual fee (for Blue and many other consumer and business cards) and a $450 annual fee (for the Platinum Card.)  Annual fees for the Green card start at $95, while Gold card annual fees start at $125.

In 2005 American Express introduced Clear, advertised as the first credit card with no fees of any kind. It also incorporates the [[ExpressPay|ExpressPay]] technology premiered with the Blue card.  Also in 2005, American Express introduced One, a credit card with a "Savings Accelerator Plan" that contributes 1% of eligible purchases into an [[FDIC|FDIC]]-[[Deposit_insurance|insured]] High-Yield [[Savings_account|Savings Account]]. Other cards introduced in 2005 included "The Knot" and "The Nest" Credit Cards from American Express, co-branded cards developed with the wedding planning website theknot.com. They have also introduced City Reward Cards that earn INSIDE Rewards points to eat, drink, and play at New York, Chicago and LA hot spots.

Also, in 2005, American Express introduced [[ExpressPay|ExpressPay]], a wireless [[RFID|RFID]] payment method that requires a card to simply be tapped to a special reader and not swiped. This technology replaced the smart chip on the Blue card. Many merchant and restaurant partners including [[7-Eleven|7-Eleven]], [[CVS/pharmacy|CVS/pharmacy]], [[McDonald's|McDonald's]], [[Regal_Entertainment_Group|Regal Entertainment Group]], and [[Ritz_Camera|Ritz Camera]], now offer ExpressPay at most or all of their locations. The technology was tested on the ski bus from [[Salt_Lake_City|Salt Lake City]] to local resorts.

In 2006, the UK division of American Express licensed the [[Product_Red|Product Red]] brand and began to issue a [[American_Express_Red|Red Card]]. With each cardmember purchase the company contributes to good causes through [[The_Global_Fund|The Global Fund]] to help African women and children suffering from HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases.

In 2007, American Express again raised the annual fee for their American Platinum charge cards, moving the Personal cards fee to $450, and the Business division to $395. With the increase, customers now receive four complimentary companion coach tickets per calendar year. Additionally, a long rumored "relationship" fee of $5,000 to establish a Centurion card was added. The annual fee of $2,500 remains the same, however.

Features: Some versions of the card include various features such as [[Damage_waiver|Damage waiver]] on cars rented with the card, and accident insurance during travel bought with the card.

===The "Boston Fee Party"===
From the early 1980s until the early 1990s, American Express was known for cutting its [[Interchange_fees|merchant fees]] (also known as a "discount rate") to merchants and restaurants if they accepted only American Express and no other credit or charge cards. This prompted competitors such as Visa and MasterCard to cry foul for a while as the tactics "locked" restaurants into American Express. 

However, in [[1991|1991]], several restaurants in [[Boston|Boston]] started accepting and encouraging the use of Visa and MasterCard because of their far lower fees as compared to American Express's fees at the time (which were about 4% for each transaction versus around 1.2% at the time for Visa and MasterCard). A few even stopped accepting American Express credit and charge cards. The revolt, known as the "Boston Fee Party" in reference to the [[Boston_Tea_Party|Boston Tea Party]], quickly spread nationwide to over 250 restaurants across the US, including restaurants in other cities such as [[New_York_City|New York City]], [[Chicago|Chicago]], and [[Los_Angeles|Los Angeles]]. In response, American Express decided to reduce its discount rate gradually to compete more effectively and add new merchants to its network such as supermarkets and drugstores. Many elements of the exclusive acceptance program were also phased out so American Express could effectively encourage businesses to add American Express cards to their existing list of payment options.

Currently, American Express' average US merchant rate is about 2.5%, while the average Visa/MasterCard credit card US merchant rate is about 2% (Visa/MasterCard signature [[debit_card|debit card]]s are at 1.7%). Some merchant sectors, such as quick-service restaurants including [[McDonald's|McDonald's]], have special reduced rates to accommodate business needs and profit margins.

Not all the changes from 1991 have taken wind: A very small number of restaurants in major cities still exclusively accept American Express because the vast majority of their customers primarily use Amex cards.  Likewise, [[Neiman_Marcus|Neiman Marcus]] accepts only American Express and their store card; however, the current exclusive agreement with American Express is due to expire soon and may not be renewed as an exclusive agreement. [[Costco|Costco]] also has an exclusivity agreement with American Express; however, Costco's agreement with Amex was the result of a long negotiation process for exclusive acceptance with multiple parties that also included Visa, MasterCard, and Discover.

=== 金融服務歷史 ===
During the 1980s, American Express embarked on its dream to become a financial services supercompany. In mid-1981 it purchased [[Shearson_Loeb_Rhoades_Inc|Shearson Loeb Rhoades Inc]] the second largest [[securities_firm|securities firm]] in the US. In 1984 it purchased the 90-year old [[Investors_Diversified_Services|Investors Diversified Services]], bringing with it a fleet of financial advisors and investment products. Also in 1984, American Express acquired the [[investment_banking|investment banking]] and trading firm, [[Lehman_Brothers|Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb]], and added it to the Shearson family, creating Shearson Lehman/American Express.  In 1988, the Firm acquired [[E.F._Hutton|E.F. Hutton]], forming [[Shearson_Lehman_Hutton|Shearson Lehman Hutton]] until 1990, when the Firm's name became Shearson Lehman Brothers.  When Harvey Golub took the reins in 1993 he negotiated the sale of Shearson's retail brokerage and [[Investment_management|asset management]] business to [[Primerica|Primerica]] and in following year, spun-off of the remaining investment banking and institutional businesses as [[Lehman_Brothers|Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc]].

In April [[1992|1992]], American Express spun off its subsidiary, [[First_Data_Corp.|First Data Corp.]], in an IPO.  Then, in October [[1996|1996]], the company distributed the remaining majority of its holdings in First Data Corp., reducing its ownership to less than 5%.

In December [[2000|2000]], American Express agreed to acquire the credit card portfolio of [[Bank_of_Hawaii|Bank of Hawaii]], then a division of [[Pacific_Century_Financial_Corp.|Pacific Century Financial Corp.]] Bank of Hawaii, along with its sister bank, Pacific Century Bank, became the first U.S. banks to issue American Express cards when the deal was completed the following year.  In January 2006, American Express sold its Bank of Hawaii card portfolio to [[Bank_of_America|Bank of America]] ([[MBNA|MBNA]]). Bank of America will issue [[VISA_(credit_card)|Visa]] and American Express cards under the Bank of Hawaii name. 

In January 2004, American Express reached a deal to have its cards issued by a U.S. bank, [[MBNA|MBNA]] America.  Initially decried by [[MasterCard|MasterCard]] executives as nothing but an "experiment", these cards were released in October of 2004.  Some said that the relationship was going to be threatened by MBNA's merger with Bank of America, a major [[VISA_(credit_card)|Visa]] issuer and original developer of VISA. However, an agreement was reached between American Express and Bank of America on December 21, 2005.  Under the terms of the agreement, Bank of America will own the customer loans and American Express will process the transactions.  Also, American Express will dismiss Bank of America from its antitrust litigation against Visa, MasterCard and a number of U.S. banks.  Finally, both Bank of America and American Express also said an existing card-issuing partnership between MBNA and American Express will continue after the Bank of America-MBNA merger. The first card from the partnership, the no-annual-fee Bank of America Rewards American Express card, was released on June 30, 2006.

Since then, [[Citibank|Citibank]], [[GE_Money|GE Money]], and [[USAA|USAA]] have also started issuing American Express cards. Citibank currently issues several American Express cards including an [[American_Airlines|American Airlines]] [[AAdvantage|AAdvantage]] co-branded card, while GE is currently issuing a co-branded card for [[Dillard's|Dillard's]]. [[HSBC_Bank_USA|HSBC Bank USA]] will also introduce co-branded American Express cards later this year for several of its private-label retail partners; however, those partners have yet to be announced at this time. Also, [[UBS|UBS]] launched its Resource Card program for US Wealth Management clients issuing Visa Signature credit cards and American Express charge cards linked to their customers accounts and employing a single rewards program for the two cards.

In 2005, American Express released the American Express Travelers Cheque Card, a [[stored-value_card|stored-value card]] that serves the same purposes as a [[traveler's_cheque|traveler's cheque]], but can be used in stores like a credit card. 

On [[30_September|30 September]], 2005, American Express spun off its American Express Financial Advisors unit as a publicly traded company, [[Ameriprise_Financial|Ameriprise Financial, Inc.]]. Due to this, American Express revenues for 2005 are down around $5 billion, however, like-for-like they are up 10.5% in 2005. Also, on September 30, 2005, [[RSM_McGladrey|RSM McGladrey]] acquired American Express Tax & Business Services (TBS).
