'''撒拉'''，或稱'''撒辣'''（天主教通譯）（[[希伯来语|希伯来语]]：'''שָׂרָה'''，Sara，Śārāh；[[阿拉伯语|阿拉伯语]]：'''سارة'''，''Sāra''）是[[亚伯拉罕|亚伯拉罕]]（古兰经中称为易卜拉辛）的妻子，[[以撒|以撒]]的母亲，记载在[[圣经|圣经]]·[[创世纪|创世纪]]和[[古兰经|古兰经]]中。

撒拉本名撒莱（天主教通譯：撒辣依），后来耶和华赐名给她撒拉，意：多国之母。<ref>创世记17章 http://holybible.com.cn/cus/genesis/17.htm</ref>撒拉一词在希伯来语中的原意是“公主”<ref>Strong's Hebrew http://biblehub.net/searchstrongs.php?q=sarah</ref>。她也是亚伯拉罕的同父异母的妹妹，后来嫁给亚伯拉罕为妻。<ref>创世记20章 http://holybible.com.cn/cus/genesis/20.htm</ref>撒拉90岁生下以撒，以撒的后裔就是希伯来人。<ref>创世记21章 http://holybible.com.cn/cus/genesis/21.htm</ref>

==圣经记载== 
撒拉原来的名字称为'''撒莱'''（[[希伯来语|希伯来语]]：'''שָׂרַי''' / '''שָׂרָי'''，'''Saray'''），她结婚时丈夫名为'''亚伯兰'''（希伯来语：'''אברם'''），他们住在哈兰城。这时耶和华呼召亚伯兰离开家乡，去到一个不知道的地方（后来证实是[[迦南|迦南]]）。亚伯兰带着侄儿罗得和撒莱一同前去。<ref>创世记12章 http://cnbible.com/cus/genesis/12.htm</ref>不过，当他们到达时遇见了饥荒，于是逃荒到[[埃及|埃及]]。亚伯兰担忧撒莱的美丽会给他带来危险，没有公开他们真实的关系，谎称撒莱是她的妹妹。因此法老将撒莱带进王宫，赠送给亚伯兰许多财物。然而耶和华降严重的灾祸给法老和他的全家，于是法老怀疑起事实的真相，他责备亚伯兰并吩咐他把妻子带走。根据犹太人的传说，法老被亚伯兰的行为感动，将{{fact|自己的女儿}}[[夏甲|夏甲]]送给撒莱作使女。<ref>[http://road.fun.net.tw/modules/newschina/article.php?storyid=488 澎湖伯講道集 - 苦命母子之哭 - 澎湖伯講道集9 - 澎湖伯講道集] 夏甲是亞伯拉罕的妻子撒拉的使女……更可能是埃及王法老贈給他們的禮物，因為【舊約】創世紀十二章16節記載說： 「法老因這婦人就厚待亞伯蘭，亞伯蘭得了許多牛羊、駱駝、公驢、母驢、僕婢。」當時的僕俾是常被主人當作禮物隨便送人的。</ref>

这时耶和华应许亚伯兰要成为多国的父，而撒莱这时还没有生孩子。为了帮助丈夫实现自己的命运，撒莱将自己的埃及使女夏甲给丈夫作[[妾|妾]]。夏甲很快怀了孕，开始轻视女主人，撒莱向丈夫诉苦，亚伯兰回答说他可以任意对待夏甲。撒莱苦待夏甲，迫使她逃到沙漠。夏甲在沙漠遇见一位天使，告诉她她的后裔极其繁多，鼓励她回到女主人那里。夏甲回去以后，生下了儿子[[以实玛利|以实玛利]]。

[[以实玛利|以实玛利]]13岁那年，耶和华与亚伯兰以割礼为约。那年亚伯兰罕99岁，他和[[以实玛利|以实玛利]]一同行割礼。耶和华赐名亚伯兰为亚伯拉罕，他的妻子撒莱为撒拉。<ref>创世记17章 http://cnbible.com/cus/genesis/17.htm</ref>
<!-- Afterwards God changed their names to Abraham and Sarah to help them fulfill their new destiny as progenitors of the future [[Children_of_Israel|nation of Israel]]. In [[希伯来语|希伯来语]], the name ''Avram'' means "exalted father" or, alternately, "father of Aram," the country where Abraham was born. ''Sarai'' means "my woman of high rank", referring to her relationship with her husband. Now their names would be ''Avraham'', meaning "father of many," and ''Sarah'', meaning "woman of high rank". Then God sent three angels in the guise of men to inform the couple of the impending birth of [[Isaac|Isaac]]. Abraham laughed with joy at the news, as he would be 100 years old at the time of the birth, but Sarah laughed with doubt, as she would be 90 years old and the ways of women had long since ceased for her.

Abraham next moved to [[Gerar|Gerar]], where Sarah was again taken by the ruler to become his wife after she claimed Abraham was her brother. Abimelech, however, was warned by God in a dream not to touch Sarah. When Abimelech reproved Abraham for the deception, Abraham justified himself by explaining that Sarah was the daughter of his father but not of his mother (Gen. 20:1-12).

Immediately after this incident, Sarah bore a son, Isaac. God instructed Abraham to name him after the laughter which Sarah had made when her son's birth was prophesied by the angel. -->

<!-- According to [[Rashi|Rashi]], who lived thousands of years later, people questioned whether the 100-year old Abraham really was the father of the child, as he and Sarah had lived together for decades without conceiving. Instead, people gossiped that Abimelech was the true father. For this reason, according to Rashi, God made Isaac's features exactly the same as Abraham's, so no one could claim a different paternity.

As Isaac grew up, his older half-brother Ishmael began to mock him, and Sarah demanded that Abraham send away both Hagar and Ishmael to protect Isaac. Some believe that Sarah's shunning, and the hard life of exile that followed, angered Ishmael and that this is one of the causes of strife between Islam and Christianity, as Ishmael became a prophet. Years later, at the death of Abraham, Isaac and Ishmael came together again to bury their father in the [[Cave_of_the_Patriarchs|Cave of the Patriarchs]] in [[Hebron|Hebron]] (Gen. 25:9).

Sarah died in [[Kiryat_Arba|Kiryat Arba]] (קרית ארבע), or [[Hebron|Hebron]], at the age of 127 years. Her death prompted Abraham to purchase a family burial plot, and he approached Ephron the Hittite to sell him the Cave of Machpelah (Cave of the Patriarchs). Ephron demanded an exhorbitant price of 400 pieces of silver, which Abraham paid in full. The Cave of Machpelah would eventually be the burial site for all three Jewish patriarchs and three of the four matriarchs—Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and [[Rebekah|Rebekah]], and [[Jacob|Jacob]] and [[Leah|Leah]]. [[Rachel|Rachel]] was buried on the road to [[Bethlehem|Bethlehem]].

No further reference to Sarah is found in the Hebrew canon, except in Isa. Ii. 2, where the prophet appeals to his hearers to "look unto Abraham your father, and unto Sarah that bar. -->

<!-- ==In Rabbinic literature==
In [[Rabbinic_literature|Rabbinic literature]], Sarah was the Wife of Abraham, being the daughter of his brother Haran. She was called also "Iscah" (Gen. xi. 29), because her beauty attracted general attention and admiration (Meg. 14a). She was so beautiful that all other persons seemed apes in comparison ([[Talmud|Talmud]], Bava Batra 58a). Even the hardships of her journey with Abraham did not affect her beauty (Midrash Gen. Rabbah xi. 4). According to another explanation, she was called Iscah because she had prophetic vision (Meg. l.c.). She was superior to Abraham in the gift of prophecy (Midrash Exodus Rabbah i. 1.). She was the "crown" of her husband; and he obeyed her words because he recognized this superiority on her part (Gen. R. xlvii. 1). She was the only woman whom God deemed worthy to be addressed by Him directly, all the other prophetesses receiving their revelations through angels (ib. xlv. 14). On their journeys Abraham converted the men, and Sarah the women (ib. xxxix. 21). She was called originally "Sarai", i.e., "my woman of high rank", because she was the princess of her house and of her tribe; later she was called "Sarah" = "woman of high rank" because she was recognized generally as such (Talmud Berachot 13a; Genesis Rabbah xlvii. 1).

The Talmud lists her as a prophetess. -->

<!-- ==Repetitions in the narrative==
The story of Sarah's life, brief and incomplete as it is, presents nevertheless curious repetitions, e.g. the incident with Pharaoh and a similar incident with Abimelech. Marriages with half-sisters were, in primitive matriarchy, regarded as anything but incestuous. From the point of view of the history of culture these episodes are very instructive, but some consider it improbable that Abraham would have run the risk twice. Moreover, a similar incident is reported with regard to Isaac and Rebecca. This recurrence causes some to believe that none of the accounts is to be accepted as historical; they maintain that all three are variations of a theme common to the popular oral histories of the Patriarchs; that women were married in the way here supposed is not to be doubted. The purpose of the story is to extol the heroines as most beautiful and show that the Patriarchs were under the special protection of the Deity. The promise of Isaac and the explanation of the name are given in duplicate. First, Abraham is the recipient of the promise, and he laughs (ib. xvii. 15-21). In the second narrative. Abraham again is given the promise, but Sarah laughs. Finally, the name receives a third justification in Sarah's exclamation at his birth. -->

<!-- ==Christianity==
In the [[New_Testament|New Testament]], Sarah and the [[Jerusalem_above|Jerusalem above]] are called "free woman" (Ga 4:22-5:1). She is commemorated as a saint in the [[Calendar_of_Saints_(Lutheran)|Calendar of Saints]] of the [[Lutheran_Church_-_Missouri_Synod|Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod]]. -->
