'''圣保罗教堂'''（{{lang-en|St Paul's Cathedral}}；另譯為'''圣保罗大教堂'''），是[[英国圣公会|英国圣公会]][[聖公會倫敦教區|伦敦教区]]的[[主教座堂|主教座堂]]，坐落于[[英国|英国]][[伦敦市|伦敦市]]，[[巴洛克建筑|巴洛克建筑]]的代表，以其壮观的[[圓頂|圓頂]]而闻名。现存建筑建于17世纪。

原址教堂最初建立於西元604年，早期建築多次遭火災與海盜破壞，直至1087年後情況才有改觀，教堂首要新建築於1148年完成，而後維持了數百年的榮境，在中世紀成為信仰中心。

十六世紀宗教改革的浪潮中，原本的聖保羅教堂（[[哥特式建築|哥特式建築]]）從建築結構到內部組織都受到了強烈的衝擊，1561年閃電擊中了教堂代表性的尖塔，火焰毀損了主要木造結構，雖有修復計畫，又因內戰停擺並未完成。1650年代，建築已處於嚴重失修的狀態，直至1666年[[倫敦大火|倫敦大火]]，教堂建築幾乎付之一炬。

1675年教堂開始重建，主要建築師為[[克里斯多佛·雷恩|克里斯多佛·雷恩]]，修建完成的主要外部樣式即為現在所見的巴洛克式樣貌。<ref>[https://www.stpauls.co.uk/history-collections/history/cathedral-history-timeline 官網]</ref>

== 早先的主教座堂 ==
[[伦敦主教区|伦敦主教区]]成立于604年，当时的主教座堂已经位于[[Ludgate_Hill|Ludgate Hill]]并奉献给[[圣保罗|圣保罗]]。Ludgate山本身与宗教有历史悠久的联系。据信这里起初是古代[[巨石阵|巨石阵]]遗址。后来有一座奉献给女神[[狄安娜|狄安娜]]的神庙，与当时位于[[西敏|西敏]]的[[阿波罗神庙|阿波罗神庙]]遥遥相望。

=== 诺曼人之前 ===
# 第一座主教座堂是[[撒克森人|撒克森人]]用木头建造的。毁于675年。 
# 685年，主教座堂用石头重建。961年被[[维京人|维京人]]摧毁。
# 第三座主教座堂始建于962年，在1087年大火中与整个城市一同毁灭。

第四座聖保羅座堂，即“老聖保羅”（Old St Paul's）在1087年大火之後開始建造，花費約200年時間才建成。

<!-- The task of designing a replacement structure was assigned to [[Christopher_Wren|Christopher Wren]] in [[1668|1668]], along with over fifty other City churches. His first design (to build a replacement on the foundations of the old cathedral) was rejected in [[1669|1669]]. The second design, in the shape of a [[希腊十字|希腊十字]] (circa [[1670|1670]]-[[1672|1672]]) was rejected as too radical, as was a revised design which resulted in the 1:24 scale "Great Model", currently on display in the crypt of the cathedral. The 'warrant' design was accepted in [[1675|1675]] and building work began in June. This design included a smaller dome with a spire on top, however [[Charles_II_of_England|King Charles II]] had given Wren permission to make "ornamental" changes to the approved design, and Wren took the liberty to radically rework the design to the current form, including the large central dome and the towers at the West end. The cathedral was completed on [[October_20|October 20]] [[1708|1708]], Wren's 76th birthday (although the first service was held on [[December_2|December 2]] [[1697|1697]]).

=== 描述 ===
<!-- The cathedral is built of [[Portland_stone|Portland stone]] in a late [[Renaissance|Renaissance]] style that is England's sober [[Baroque|Baroque]]. Its impressive dome was inspired by [[St._Peter's_Basilica|St Peter's Basilica]] in [[Rome|Rome]]. It rises 108米 to the cross at its summit, making it a famous London landmark. Wren achieved a pleasing appearance by actually building three domes: the tall outer dome is non-structural but impressive to view, the lower inner dome provides an artistically balanced interior, and between the two is a structural cone which supports the apex structure and the outer dome panelling. During the building of its later stages, Wren was said to have been hauled up to the rafters in a basket to inspect the progress of the work. -->
[[File:St_Pauls_Picturesque_England_Laura_Valentine_1891.JPG|thumb]]
<!-- The [[cathedral|cathedral]] is to the east from the Great West Door. The [[nave|nave]] has three small chapels in the two adjoining [[aisle|aisle]]s – ''All Souls'' and ''St Dunstan's'' in the north aisle and the ''Chapel of the [[Order_of_St_Michael_and_St_George|Order of St Michael and St George]]'' in the south aisle. The main space of the cathedral is centred under the Dome; it rises 108.4 metres from the cathedral floor and holds three circular galleries – the internal ''Whispering Gallery'', the external ''Stone Gallery'', and the external ''Golden Gallery''. 

''[[Whispering_gallery|Whispering Gallery]]'' runs around the interior of the Dome and is 259 steps up from ground-level. It gets its name from a serendipitious quirk of dome construction: a whisper against its wall at any point is audible to a listener with their ear held to the point diametrically opposite.

[[Quire_(architecture)|Quire]] extends to the east of the dome and holds the stalls for the [[clergy|clergy]] and the choir as well as the cathedral's [[organ_(music)|organ]]. The organ was first commissioned in [[1694|1694]] and the current instrument is the third biggest in Britain with 7,189 pipes and 138 stops; it is enclosed in an impressive case built by [[Grinling_Gibbons|Grinling Gibbons]]. To the north and south of the dome are the transepts of the North Choir and the South Choir.

The north west tower contains 13 bells, while the south west tower contains 4 bells including Great Paul, which was cast in 1881, and Great Tom (the hour bell), which has been recast twice, after being moved from the old [[Palace_of_Westminster|Palace of Westminster]]. -->

=== 雷恩之后的历史 ===
主教座堂幸存至今，<!--despite being targeted during [[the_Blitz|the Blitz]] --> 在1940年10月10日和1941年4月17日被炸弹击中仍然幸存。

==== 现代 ====
英国王室在[[西敏寺|西敏寺]]举办大多数重要婚礼、洗礼和葬礼，但[[查尔斯王子|查尔斯王子]]和 [[黛安娜王妃|黛安娜王妃]]的婚礼却在圣保罗座堂举行。
<!-- In [[2001|2001]], Britain's memorial service to honour the victims of the [[September_11,_2001_attacks|September 11, 2001 attacks]] was held at St Paul's 主教座堂, which 英国王室 and then-U.S. ambassador William Farish attended. He spoke, as did [[Prince_Philip,_Duke_of_Edinburgh|Prince Philip]]. Farish said just before he resigned as ambassador in [[2004|2004]] in ''[[The_Times|The Times]]'' that this service showed the strong 英美之间关系。It also held, on November 1st 2005, a memorial service for [[7_July_2005_London_bombings_memorials_and_services|the July 7th bombings]].

主教座堂对公众开放, though there is a charge for non-worshipping visitors. In [[2000|2000]], 主教座堂 began a major [[building_restoration|restoration programme]], scheduled for completion in [[2008|2008]], to celebrate the 300th anniversary of its opening. A ceremony to celebrate the anniversary was directed by [[Patrick_Garland|Patrick Garland]]. The restoration programme is expected to cost £40 million, and involves not only repair and cleaning of the building, but also improvement of visitor facilities - such as accessibility for the disabled, and provision of additional educational facilities. -->
