甘油三酯通过[[脂肪酶|脂肪酶]]、[[胆汁|胆汁]]和[[水解|水解]]乳化，产生[[脂肪酸|脂肪酸]]、甘油二酯和{{le|甘油单酯|Monoglyceride}}的混合物<ref>{{cite book|editors=Young, Barbara & Wheater, Paul|title=Wheater's functional histology: a text and colour atlas|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|year=2006|isbn=978-0-443-06850-8|page=279|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=88tla60sHAUC&pg=PA279}}</ref>。{{transh}}These then pass from the intestinal lumen into the [[enterocyte|enterocyte]], where they are re-esterified to form [[triglyceride|triglyceride]]. The triglyceride is then combined with [[phospholipids|phospholipids]], [[cholesterol|cholesterol]] [[ester|ester]], and [[Apolipoprotein_B|apolipoprotein B48]] to form [[chylomicrons|chylomicrons]]. These chylomicrons then pass into the lacteals, forming a milky substance known as [[chyle|chyle]]. The lacteals merge to form larger lymphatic vessels that transport the chyle to the [[thoracic_duct|thoracic duct]] where it is emptied into the bloodstream at the [[subclavian_vein|subclavian vein]].<ref>{{cite book|authors=Newsholme, Eric & Leech, Anthony|title=Functional Biochemistry in Health and Disease|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2009|isbn=978-0-471-98820-5|page=79|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NY4GZ0wUaiMC&pg=PA79}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|editors=Montague, Susan E. et al|title=Physiology for nursing practice|publisher=Elsevier|year=2005|isbn=978-0-7020-2676-8|page=502|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nddqAAAAMAAJ&q=lacteal+chyle&dq=lacteal+chyle}}</ref>

At this point, the fats are in the bloodstream in the form of chylomicrons. Once in the blood, chylomicrons are subject to delipidation by [[lipoprotein_lipase|lipoprotein lipase]]. Eventually, enough lipid has been lost and additional apolipoproteins gained, that the resulting particle (now referred to as a chylomicron remnant) can be taken up by the [[liver|liver]]. From the liver, the fat released from chylomicron remnants can be re-exported to the blood as the triglyceride component of [[very_low-density_lipoprotein|very low-density lipoprotein]]s. Very low-density lipoproteins are also subject to delipidation by vascular lipoprotein lipase, and deliver fats to tissues throughout the body.  In particular, the released fatty acids can be stored in [[adipose|adipose]] cells as triglycerides. As triglycerides are lost from very low-density lipoproteins, the lipoprotein particles become smaller and denser (since protein is denser than lipid) and ultimately become [[low-density_lipoprotein|low-density lipoprotein]]s. A great deal has been written about low-density lipoproteins because they are thought to be [[Atherogenesis|atherogenic]].

Note that in contrast to any other route of absorption from the small intestine, the lymphatic system avoids [[first_pass_metabolism|first pass metabolism]].{{transf}}
