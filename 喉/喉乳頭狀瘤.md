==Signs and symptoms==

===Adults===

In adults, the symptoms of laryngeal papillomatosis are hoarseness, or a strained or breathy voice. Size and placement of the tumors dictate the change in the person's voice. Breathing difficulties may occur but more commonly are found in children.{{mcn|date=September 2017}}

===Children===

In babies and small children, the signs and symptoms include a weak cry, trouble swallowing, noisy breathing, and chronic cough. Noisy breathing may be a [[stridor|stridor]], which can sound like a whistle or a snore, and is a sign that the laryngeal or tracheal parts of the airway are narrowing.{{mcn|date=September 2017}}
==Transmission==
In general, physicians are not sure what causes certain people to develop laryngeal papillomatosis while others who have been exposed to HPV types 6 and 11 do not develop the disease. Since the disease is most commonly found in children, the disease may be caused by an infant contracting HPV from the mother during vaginal child birth.<ref name=nidcd>{{cite web |url=http://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/voice/pages/laryngeal.aspx |title=Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis or Laryngeal Papillomatosis |year=2011 |work= |publisher=National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders |accessdate=9 August 2013}}</ref>  There is no evidence that it is transmitted through oral sex, and it is not considered a [[sexually_transmitted_disease|sexually transmitted disease]].{{mcn|date=September 2017}} While laryngeal papillomatosis itself is not thought to be due to  sexual transmission, maternal genital infections with either HPV types 6 or 11 result from sexual transmission.  Infections with these HPV types can cause [[genital_warts|genital warts]] and can be prevented by [[HPV_vaccine|HPV vaccine]]s that include HPV 6 and 11 [[antigen|antigen]]s (e.g., quadrivalent or nonavalent HPV vaccines).<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 28034371 | doi=10.1016/j.cmi.2016.12.017 | volume=22 Suppl 5 | title=Vaccines against human papillomavirus infections: protection against cancer, genital warts or both? | author=Joura EA, Pils S | journal=Clin Microbiol Infect | pages=S125–S127| year=2016 }}</ref>  Routine vaccination of pre-adolescent girls with these vaccines is expected to prevent persistent HPV 6 or HPV 11 genital infections among expectant mothers and thus prevent secondary laryngeal infections to their newborns that can lead to laryngeal papillomatosis.

==Diagnosis==
A [[physician|physician]] may diagnose laryngeal papillomatosis by placing a mirror into a patient's mouth to reflect light onto the vocal cords and examining the larynx. More often, a doctor or a trained speech-language pathologist diagnoses laryngeal papillomatosis by an indirect laryngoscopy in the office. This procedure involves the placement of a flexible, fiber optic camera through the patient's nose to view the vocal folds in the throat or the use of a straight, rigid camera placed through the mouth to view the vocal folds.<ref name=nidcd/>

The most accurate way to diagnose laryngeal papillomatosis is for a [[biopsy|biopsy]] to be conducted and for the lesion to be tested for HPV. This procedure takes place in an operating room with the patient under general anesthesia. This is sometimes the best option for small children. This disease is most often misdiagnosed as [[asthma|asthma]], [[croup|croup]], or [[chronic_bronchitis|chronic bronchitis]].{{mcn|date=September 2017}} The consequences  may be serious, as papillomas are at least partially obstructing the airway to cause these symptoms and should be removed immediately.<ref name=nidcd/>

== Treatment ==

Traditional [[surgery|surgery]] and [[carbon_dioxide_laser|carbon dioxide laser]] surgery, a "no touch" removal of affected tissue, are forms of treatment for laryngeal papillomatosis. Carbon dioxide laser removal is the most common removal method.{{mcn|date=September 2017}} The carbon dioxide laser must be used precisely to prevent scarring, [[fibrosis|fibrosis]], and [[laryngeal_web_malformation|laryngeal web malformation]]. In children, carbon dioxide laser is effective for removing papillomas on the larynx.
[[Photodynamic_therapy|Photodynamic therapy]] controls [[tumor|tumor]]s by using targeted dyes and bright light to illuminate tumors.<ref name=nidcd/> In this procedure, a physician injects a light-sensitive dye that is only absorbed by the tumors. Then the physician activates the dye using a bright light, and the tumors are eliminated. This procedure has also been able to decrease the number of tumors that reoccur.<ref name=nidcd/>

Another method is [[tracheotomy|tracheotomy]], which reroutes air around the affected area. An incision is made in the front of the patient's neck, and a [[Tracheal_tube|breathing tube]] is inserted through a hole (stoma) into the windpipe. The patient is then able to breathe through the tube. Although this is usually temporary, some patients must use the tube indefinitely.<ref name=nidcd/> This method should be avoided if at all possible, since insertion of a breathing tube may cause the tumors to form as far down as the lungs.{{mcn|date=September 2017}}

Many [[antiviral_drug|antiviral drug]]s like [[cidofovir|cidofovir]] have been used to treat laryngeal papillomatosis, but none completely stops the tumors from growing. Most antivirals are injected to control the frequency of tumor growth. The efficacy of the same is debated and subject to research. Some side effects of antivirals include dizziness, headaches, and body aches. Adjuvant chemotherapy with [[interferon|interferon]] may be used in very severe cases.<ref>Color Atlas of ENT Diagnosis, 4th ed (Thieme 2003){{page needed|date=October 2016}}</ref>
Regardless of the treatment used, the tumors will recur. In severe cases, tumors may occur once or twice a month. In less severe cases, tumors may occur once or twice a year. In addition, speech therapy may be beneficial to assist with vocal hygiene and retraining of voice.{{mcn|date=September 2017}}
