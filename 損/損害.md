[[Joel_Feinberg|Joel Feinberg]] gives an account of harms as setbacks to interests.<ref>Feinberg 1984.</ref>  He distinguishes ''welfare interests'' from ''ulterior interests''.  Hence on his view there are two kinds of harms.




''[[well-being|Welfare]] interests'' are 

:

:interests in the continuance for a foreseeable interval of one's life, and the interests in one's own physical health and vigor, the [[bodily_integrity|integrity]] and [[homeostasis|normal functioning of one's body]], the absence of absorbing pain and suffering or grotesque disfigurement, minimal intellectual acuity, emotional stability, the absence of groundless anxieties and resentments, the capacity to engage normally in social intercourse and to enjoy and maintain friendships, at least minimal income and financial security, a tolerable social and physical environment, and a certain amount of freedom from interference and coercion.<ref>Feinberg 1984, p. 37.</ref>




''Ulterior interests'' are "a person's more ultimate goals and aspirations," such as "producing good novels or works of art, solving a crucial scientific problem, achieving high political office, successfully raising a family . . .".
