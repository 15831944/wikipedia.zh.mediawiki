《[[藩篱之钟|藩篱之钟]]》（英文：[[The_Division_Bell|The Division Bell]]），是英国前卫摇滚乐队[[平克·弗洛伊德|平克·弗洛伊德]]的第14张录音室专辑，1994年3月28日和4月4日分别由[[EMI唱片|EMI]]和[[哥伦比亚唱片|哥伦比亚唱片]]在英国和美国发行。该专辑的音乐主要由吉他手兼歌手[[大卫·吉尔摩|大卫·吉尔摩]]和键盘手[[理查德·赖特_(音乐家)|理查德·赖特]]创作，这是[[理查德·赖特_(音乐家)|理查德·赖特]]自1973年专辑《[[月之暗面|月之暗面]]》以来第一次在平克·弗洛伊德的专辑中担任主唱。大卫·吉尔摩的未婚妻{{Link-en|Polly Samson|Polly Samson}}与乐队合写了许多有关沟通主题的歌词。录音地点包括乐队的Britannia Row录音室以及吉尔摩的[[阿斯托里亚_(南达科他州)|阿斯托里亚]]船上录音室。制作团队包括乐队长久以来的盟友，如制作人{{Link-en|Bob Ezrin|Bob Ezrin}}、工程师{{Link-en|Andy Jackson|Andy Jackson}}、萨克斯演奏者{{Link-en|Dick Parry|Dick Parry}}。

《藩篱之钟》达到了英国和美国排行榜的第一名，但收到了不同评价。紧接着乐队便进行了欧洲和美国的巡演。它在美国发行时获得双铂金[[音乐唱片销售认证|认证]]，并在1999年获得三铂金。专辑藩篱之钟时期未被使用的素材成为平克·弗洛伊德2014年的下一张也是最后一张专辑《无尽之河》的一部分。

== 录制 ==
[[File:Astoria_(Péniche).jpg|left]]
在1993年1月，[[大卫·吉尔摩|吉尔摩]]、马森和赖特开始在改造后的Britannia Row录音室即兴创作新的素材。他们招募了贝斯手{{Link-en|Guy Pratt|Guy Pratt}}；<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2005|p=356}}</ref> 
{{TransH}}
according to Mason, "an interesting phenomenon occurred, which was that Pratt's playing tended to change the mood of the music we had created on our own".<ref name="Mason 2005 315">{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=315}}</ref> Without the legal problems experienced during production of their 1987 album, ''[[A_Momentary_Lapse_of_Reason|A Momentary Lapse of Reason]]'', Gilmour was at ease; if he felt the band were "getting somewhere", he would record them on a two-track [[Digital_Audio_Tape|DAT recorder]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2005|p=354}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Di Perna|2002|p=86}}</ref> At one point Gilmour surreptitiously recorded Wright playing, capturing material which formed the basis for three pieces of music.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=314–315}}</ref>

After about two weeks the band had around 65 pieces of music. With engineer [[Andrew_Jackson_(recording_engineer)|Andy Jackson]] back on the team, and [[Bob_Ezrin|Bob Ezrin]] as co-producer, production moved to Gilmour's houseboat and recording studio, ''Astoria''. The band listened to and voted on each track, and whittled the material down to about 27 pieces of music. Eliminating some tracks, and merging others, they arrived at about eleven songs. Song selection was based upon a system of points, whereby all three members would award marks out of ten to each candidate song, a system skewed somewhat by Wright's decision to award his songs ten points each, and the other songs no points.<ref name="Mason314321">{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=314–321}}</ref> Wright was not contractually a full member of the band, a situation which upset him. Wright reflected: "It came very close to a point where I wasn't going to do the album, because I didn't feel that what we'd agreed was fair."<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2005|p=355}}</ref> Wright received his first songwriting credits on any Pink Floyd album since 1975's ''[[Wish_You_Were_Here_(Pink_Floyd_album)|Wish You Were Here]]''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2005|pp=354–355}}</ref>

Gilmour's fiancée, [[Polly_Samson|Polly Samson]], also received songwriting credits. Initially, her role was limited to providing encouragement for her husband, but she later helped Gilmour write "[[High_Hopes_(Pink_Floyd_song)|High Hopes]]" (a song about Gilmour's childhood and early life in [[Cambridge|Cambridge]]). Her role expanded to co-writing a further six songs, something which did not sit well with Ezrin. In an interview for ''Mojo'' magazine Gilmour admitted that Samson's contributions had "ruffled the management's [feathers]", but Ezrin later reflected that her presence was inspirational for Gilmour, and that she "pulled the whole album together".<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2005|pp=355–356}}</ref> She also helped Gilmour, who, following his divorce, had developed a [[cocaine|cocaine]] addiction.<ref name="Blakep365"/>

Keyboard player [[Jon_Carin|Jon Carin]] and drummer/percussionist [[Gary_Wallis|Gary Wallis]] were brought in to complete the band before recording began. Five backing vocalists were also hired, including [[Sam_Brown_(singer)|Sam Brown]], and ''Momentary Lapse'' tour singer [[Durga_McBroom|Durga McBroom]]. The band then moved to Olympic Studios, recorded most of the 'winning' tracks over the space of a week. After a summer break, they returned to ''Astoria'' to record more backing tracks. Ezrin worked on the various drum sounds, and previous collaborator and orchestral composer [[Michael_Kamen|Michael Kamen]] provided the album's string arrangements which were recorded at Abbey Road Studio Two by Steve McLaughlin.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=318–319}}</ref> [[Dick_Parry|Dick Parry]] played saxophone on his first Pink Floyd album for almost 20 years, on "Wearing the Inside Out", and [[Chris_Thomas_(record_producer)|Chris Thomas]] was booked to undertake the final mix.<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=356–357}}</ref> Between September and December recording and mixing sessions were held at [[Metropolis_Studios|Metropolis Studios]] in [[Chiswick|Chiswick]], and the Creek Recording Studios in London.

With the aid of Gilmour's guitar technician, Phil Taylor, Carin located some of Pink Floyd's older keyboards from the warehouse in which they had been stored, including a [[Farfisa|Farfisa]] organ. Some of the sounds [[Sampling_(music)|sampled]] from these instruments were used on the tracks "[[Take_It_Back|Take It Back]]", and "Marooned".<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|p=357}}</ref> Carin was joined on keyboards by Ezrin. [[Durga_McBroom|Durga McBroom]] supplied backing vocals alongside Sam Brown, Carol Kenyan, Jackie Sheridan, and Rebecca Leigh-White.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mabbett|1995|p=120}}</ref>

Gilmour used several styles on the album. "What Do You Want from Me" is influenced by [[Chicago_blues|Chicago blues]], and "Poles Apart" contains folksy overtones. Gilmour's improvised guitar solos on "Marooned" used a [[Digitech_Whammy|DigiTech Whammy]] pedal to [[Pitch-shifting|pitch-shift]] the guitar notes over a full octave. On "Take It Back", he used an [[EBow|EBow]], an electronic device which simulates the sound of a [[bowed_guitar|bow on the strings]], on a [[Gibson_J-200|Gibson J-200]] guitar through a Zoom effects unit.<ref name="Di Pernapp8385">{{Harvnb|Di Perna|2002|pp=83–85}}</ref>

To avoid competing against other album releases (as had happened with ''A Momentary Lapse'') Pink Floyd set a deadline of April 1994, at which point they would begin a new tour. By January of that year however, the band still had not decided on a title for the album. The list of names being considered included ''Pow Wow'' and ''Down to Earth''. At a dinner one night, writer [[Douglas_Adams|Douglas Adams]], spurred on by the promise of a  payment to his favourite charity, the [[Environmental_Investigation_Agency|Environmental Investigation Agency]], suggested "the [[division_bell|division bell]]" (used in the lyrics for "High Hopes"), and the name stuck.<ref name=mason320>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=319–320}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Mabbett|1995|pp=119–120}}</ref>

Longtime Floyd collaborator [[Storm_Thorgerson|Storm Thorgerson]] provided the album artwork. He erected two large metal heads, each the height of a [[double-decker_bus|double-decker bus]], in a field near [[Ely,_Cambridgeshire|Ely]]. The sculptures were positioned close together, and photographed in profile, to give the illusion that not only were they either facing or talking to each other, they also presented the viewer with a third face. Thorgerson mentioned the "third absent face" was a reference to [[Syd_Barrett|Syd Barrett]]. The sculptures were devised by Keith Breeden, and constructed by John Robertson.

The album was released in the UK and US on CD, vinyl, cassette and  [[Mini-Disc|mini-disc]], each with its own format and label-specific design. The artwork inside the CD [[liner_notes|liner notes]] revolves around a similar theme, with the image of the two heads formed by various other objects, such as newspapers ("A Great Day for Freedom"), coloured glass ("Poles Apart"), and [[boxing_glove|boxing glove]]s ("Lost for Words"). Pages two and three portray a picture from the Chilean [[Cerro_Tololo_Inter-American_Observatory|Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory]]. The CD tray itself had the name of Pink Floyd printed in [[Braille|Braille]] on the left front side.

On 10 January 1994 a press reception to announce ''The Division Bell'' and world tour was held at a former [[Coast_Guard_Air_Station_Elizabeth_City|US Naval Air Station]] in [[North_Carolina|North Carolina]], in the US. A purpose-built [[Skyship_600|Skyship 600]] [[airship|airship]], manufactured in the UK, toured the US until it returned to Weeksville, and was destroyed by a thunderstorm on 27 June. Pieces of the aircraft were sold as souvenirs. The band held another reception, in the UK, on 21 March. This time they used an A60 airship, translucent, and painted to look like a fish, which took journalists on a tour of London. The airship, which was lit internally so it glowed in the night sky, was also flown in northern Europe.<ref name="Poveyp270">{{Harvnb|Povey|2007|p=270}}</ref>

Despite decent sales, ''The Division Bell'' received mixed reviews. Tom Sinclair of ''[[Entertainment_Weekly|Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave it a "D", writing that "avarice is the only conceivable explanation for this glib, vacuous cipher of an album, which is notable primarily for its stomach-turning merger of progressive-rock pomposity and New Age noodling".<ref name="Tomsinclair">{{Citation | last = Sinclair | first = Tom | title = The Division Bell | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,301952,00.html | publisher = ew.com | date = 22 April 1994 | accessdate = 9 January 2010}}</ref> ''[[Rolling_Stone|Rolling Stone]]''{{'s}} Tom Graves criticised Gilmour's performance, stating that his guitar solos had "settled into rambling, indistinct asides that are as forgettable as they used to be indelible ... only on 'What Do You Want from Me' does Gilmour sound like he cares".<ref name="rollingstone"/> Nevertheless, the album was nominated in the 1995 [[Brit_awards|Brit awards]] for the "Best Album by a British Artist",<ref>{{Citation | title = The Nominees | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=wgsEAAAAMBAJ | work=[[Billboard_(magazine)|Billboard]] | page = 48 | date = 18 February 1995 | accessdate = 13 January 2010}}</ref> but lost to [[Blur_(band)|Blur]]'s ''[[Parklife|Parklife]]''.

In [[Uncut_(magazine)|''Uncut'']]'s 2011 ''Pink Floyd: The Ultimate Music Guide'', Graeme Thomson wrote that ''The Division Bell '' "might just be the dark horse of the Floyd canon. The opening [[triptych|triptych]] of songs is a hugely impressive return to something very close to the eternal essence of Pink Floyd, and much of the rest retains a quiet power and a meditative quality that betrays a genuine sense of unity."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Thomson|first=Graeme|title=The Division Bell|journal=Uncut: Ultimate Music Guide – Pink Floyd|date=June 7, 2011|issue=6|page=128|accessdate=22 July 2012}}</ref>

[[Uncut_(magazine)|Uncut]] reviewed the album once again in 2014 to celebrate the 20th anniversary reissue, and in their review praised the album for its production, citing that the album sounded much "more like a classic Pink Floyd album than 1983's ''[[The_Final_Cut_(album)|The Final Cut]]''" and throughout the album noted the empathy and connection between Wright and Gilmour, stating that these moments were "at the album's musical heart".<ref name="uncutmagazine"/>

The album was re-issued again with the [[Pink_Floyd_Records|Pink Floyd Records]] label on 26 August 2016.

== 巡演 ==
Two days after the album's release, the band's [[The_Division_Bell_Tour|Division Bell Tour]] began at [[Joe_Robbie_Stadium|Joe Robbie Stadium]], in suburban [[Miami|Miami]]. The set list began with 1967's "[[Astronomy_Domine|Astronomy Domine]]", before moving to tracks from 1987's ''[[A_Momentary_Lapse_of_Reason|A Momentary Lapse of Reason]]'', and ''The Division Bell''. Songs from ''[[Wish_You_Were_Here_(Pink_Floyd_album)|Wish You Were Here]]'' and ''[[The_Dark_Side_of_the_Moon|The Dark Side of the Moon]]'' featured, as well as ''[[The_Wall|The Wall]]''. Backing musicians included [[Sam_Brown_(singer)|Sam Brown]], Jon Carin, Claudia Fontaine, [[Durga_McBroom|Durga McBroom]], [[Dick_Parry|Dick Parry]], Guy Pratt, Tim Renwick, and Gary Wallis. The tour continued in the US through April, May and mid-June, before moving to Canada, and then returning to the US in July. As the tour reached Europe in late July, Waters was invited to join the band, but he declined, and later expressed his annoyance that some Floyd songs were being performed again in large venues. On the first night of the UK leg of the tour on 12 October, a 1,200 capacity stand collapsed, but with no serious injuries; the performance was rescheduled.<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|p=367}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Povey|2007|pp=270–280}}</ref>

During the tour an anonymous person named [[Publius_Enigma|Publius]] posted a message on an internet newsgroup, inviting fans to solve a riddle supposedly concealed in the new album. The message was verified during a show in [[Giants_Stadium|East Rutherford]], where white lights in front of the stage spelled out "Enigma Publius". During a televised concert at Earls Court in October 1994, the word "enigma" was projected in large letters on to the backdrop of the stage. Mason later acknowledged that the [[Publius_Enigma|Publius Enigma]] did exist, but it had been instigated by the record company rather than the band. As of 2014, the puzzle remains unsolved.<ref name="Blakepp363367">{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=363–367}}</ref>

The tour ended at [[Earls_Court_Exhibition_Centre|Earls Court]] on 29 October 1994, and was the group's final concert performance until [[Live_8|Live 8]]. Estimates placed the total number of tickets sold at over 5.3 million, and gross income at about $100 million.<ref>{{Harvnb|Povey|2007|p=264}}</ref> A live album of the tour, named ''[[Pulse_(Pink_Floyd_album)|Pulse]]'', and a concert video, also named [[Pulse_(Pink_Floyd_album)|Pulse]], (which was shot on 20 October 1994) were released in June 1995.<ref>{{Harvnb|Povey|2007|p=285}}</ref>
