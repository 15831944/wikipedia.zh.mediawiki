'''心理依赖'''（{{lang-en|Psychological dependence}}），亦称'''精神依赖'''，指的是在停药、停止某项活动时因情感产生的依赖导致的[[藥物戒斷|戒断]]症状（如[[煩躁|煩躁]]、[[失乐|失乐]]、[[焦慮|焦慮]]等）。<ref name="Addiction glossary" /><ref name="Cellular basis" /><ref name="Natural and drug addictions">{{cite journal | author = Olsen CM | title = Natural rewards, neuroplasticity, and non-drug addictions | journal = Neuropharmacology | volume = 61 | issue = 7 | pages = 1109–1122 |date=December 2011  | pmid = 21459101 | pmc = 3139704 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuropharm.2011.03.010}}</ref>心理依赖有时候也被认为是[[成瘾|成瘾]]症状的一部分。<ref name="NHM terms-DSM flaw" />然而，有些能够让人产生依赖性的药物并不会让人成瘾，反过来也是如此。<ref name="NHM terms-DSM flaw">{{cite book |vauthors=Malenka RC, Nestler EJ, Hyman SE |veditors=Sydor A, Brown RY | title = Molecular Neuropharmacology: A Foundation for Clinical Neuroscience | year = 2009 | publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical | location = New York | isbn = 9780071481274 | pages = 364–368| edition = 2nd | chapter = Chapter 15: Reinforcement and Addictive Disorders | quote= The defining feature of addiction is compulsive, out-of-control drug use, despite negative consequences. ...<br />Addictive drugs are both rewarding and reinforcing. ... Familiar pharmacologic terms such as tolerance, dependence, and sensitization are useful in describing some of the time-dependent processes that underlie addiction. ... <br />''Dependence'' is defined as an adaptive state that develops in response to repeated drug administration, and is unmasked during ''withdrawal'', which occurs when drug taking stops. Dependence from long-term drug use may have both a somatic component, manifested by physical symptoms, and an emotional–motivation component, manifested by dysphoria.  While physical dependence and withdrawal occur with some drugs of abuse (opiates, ethanol), these phenomena are not useful in the diagnosis of addiction because they do not occur with other drugs of abuse (cocaine, amphetamine) and can occur with many drugs that are not abused (propranolol, clonidine).<br /><br />The official diagnosis of drug addiction by the Diagnostic and Statistic Manual of Mental Disorders (2000), which makes distinctions between drug use, abuse, and substance dependence, is flawed. First, diagnosis of drug use versus abuse can be arbitrary and reflect cultural norms, not medical phenomena.  Second, the term substance dependence implies that dependence is the primary pharmacologic phenomenon underlying addiction, which is likely not true, as tolerance, sensitization, and learning and memory also play central roles. It is ironic and unfortunate that the Manual avoids use of the term addiction, which provides the best description of the clinical syndrome.}}</ref>成瘾与心理依赖都可通过[[增强|强化]]（一种[[操作制約|操作制約]]）来缓和症状，但是这两种各自有不同的强化方式。<ref name="Addiction glossary" /><ref name="Cellular basis" /> 成瘾是一种对奖励刺激的寻求，可通过正向强化的方式减轻症状。<ref name="Addiction glossary" /><ref name="Cellular basis" />心理依赖则通常需要反向强化的方式来解决，需要进行某些能够避免戒断症状的行为才能缓和。<ref name="Addiction glossary" /><ref name="Cellular basis" />
