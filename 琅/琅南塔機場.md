'''琅南塔機場'''（{{lang-en|Louang Namtha Airport}}），位於[[老撾|老撾]][[琅南塔|琅南塔]]的機場。機場在2006年至2008年間關閉，以擴建1,200米跑道至1,600米，使其能容納較大型飛機如[[ATR_72|ATR 72]]，以及興建一座700m<sup>2</sup>的新航廈<ref>"[http://www.adb.org/Documents/Resettlement_Plans/LAO/Mekong_Tourism/resettlement_framework.pdf Mekong Tourism Resettlement Project] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607072904/http://www.adb.org/Documents/Resettlement_Plans/LAO/Mekong_Tourism/resettlement_framework.pdf |date=2011-06-07 }}", Lao National Tourism Authority, page 4: ''The existing airport runway is only 1,200 m, which is 300 m short of the 1,500 m runway standard. In addition, the runway is in poor condition, full of patches, encroached with vegetation and lacks a drainage system. Thus, it is considered unsafe especially during the rainy season. At present, the airport is unable to receive ATR72 (70 seats) and only receives Chinese built YN7 (50 seat) and YN12 (12 seats). This subproject aims to improve and extend the runway, construct a drainage system, passenger terminal and small control tower, and provide emergency and fire service equipment and air navigation services.''</ref><ref>"Renovation of Luang Namtha airport delayed", Lao News Agency, 11 Nov 2007.  ''The project will upgrade the runway, 1,600-metres long and 30 metres wide, build a one storey passenger terminal of 700 square metres, and a control tower, and install other safety facilities at the airport.''</ref>。
