==內容==


<br />
:Where dips the rocky highland
:Of Sleuth Wood in the lake,
:There lies a leafy island
:Where flapping herons wake
:The drowsy water rats;
:There we've hid our faery vats,
:Full of berrys
:And of reddest stolen cherries.
:''Come away, O human child!''
:''To the waters and the wild''
:''With a faery, hand in hand.''
:''For the world's more full of weeping than you can understand.''
<br />
:Where the wave of moonlight glosses
:The dim gray sands with light,
:Far off by furthest Rosses
:We foot it all the night,
:Weaving olden dances
:Mingling hands and mingling glances
:Till the moon has taken flight;
:To and fro we leap
:And chase the frothy bubbles,
:While the world is full of troubles
:And anxious in its sleep.
:''Come away, O human child!''
:''To the waters and the wild''
:''With a faery, hand in hand,''
:''For the world's more full of weeping than you can understand.''
<br />
:Where the wandering water gushes
:From the hills above Glen-Car,
:In pools among the rushes
:That scarce could bathe a star,
:We seek for slumbering trout
:And whispering in their ears
:Give them unquiet dreams;
:Leaning softly out
:From ferns that drop their tears
:Over the young streams.
:''Come away, O human child!''
:''To the waters and the wild''
:''With a faery, hand in hand,''
:''For the world's more full of weeping than you can understand.''
<br />
:Away with us he's going,
:The solemn-eyed -
:He'll hear no more the lowing
:Of the calves on the warm hillside
:Or the kettle on the hob
:Sing peace into his breast,
:Or see the brown mice bob
:Round and round the oatmeal chest
:''For he comes the human child''
:''To the waters and the wild''
:''With a faery, hand in hand''
:''From a world more full of weeping than he can understand''
