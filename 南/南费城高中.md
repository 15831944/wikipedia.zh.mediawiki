Or how an incompetent, and, as it turns out, uncertified, principal reigned complacent through years of hostility." [...] "The events at South Philadelphia High School transformed the Ly brothers into activists, though Duong Thang disclaims the label. Having experienced the violence firsthand, they joined dozens of other Asian students in an eight-day boycott and brought legal and political pressure upon the school district, building a movement along the way."</ref>，全因先前在2009年12月3日，一些南费城高中学生襲击了同校的亚裔学生。<ref>Gammage, Jeff.

But it's the reality of life at the school, where 30 Asians were attacked by groups of mostly African American students Dec. 3. The violence sent seven Asians to hospitals and led about 50 to stage a weeklong boycott."</ref>
