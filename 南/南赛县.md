==概况 ==
Arunachal Pradesh. Situated in the easternmost part of India, the place is full of rich vegetation and mind touching hospitality of tribal life.  One of the very important town of the state is NAMSAI, the land of Golden Pagoda!

On August 15, 2014, the subdivision was declared as a new district of Arunachal Pradesh. Namsai district is the 18th district of the state.  

Nearby the Dihing river, the township has got the major boost when the much awaited bridge over the river was inaugurated in March 2002.  The bridge is 660.37m long and recently only it came to 2nd position in Arunachal after the inauguration of Parasuram Bridge, which eventually is 85 km ahead of Namsai.

Just some 30 km to the east lies the [[Diyun|Diyun]] Town.  The road to Diyun take an angle from the [[NH52|NH52]]. This road was developed by [[Oil_India_Limited|Oil India Limited]] which is still functioning though its dilapidated with each year.  Just 75 km from Tinsukia Town, the major railway station, Namsai is fast developing as a township.  With merchants from other parts of the country coming down to the place, Namsai is fast becoming a rich convergence of tribal and modern life.  With an eye towards reaching to the top of the world, the local people has set a good living standard as per as tribal life is concerned. The place is vying to become one of the educational hubs of [Arunachal Pradesh].

The people here practice Buddhist religion.  They have been following this religion since time immemorial. These people have very high value for their culture and tradition, resembling the cultures of Thailand. They are one of the highly civilized tribes in Arunachal.
