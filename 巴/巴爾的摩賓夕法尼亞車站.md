'''賓夕法尼亞車站'''（{{lang-en|Pennsylvania Station}}），簡稱'''Penn Station'''）是[[美國|美國]][[馬里蘭州|馬里蘭州]][[巴爾的摩|巴爾的摩]]的主要鐵路客運車站與樞紐。由[[紐約|紐約]]建築師{{link-en|Kenneth MacKenzie Murchison|Kenneth MacKenzie Murchison}}設計，於1911年為[[賓夕法尼亞鐵路|賓夕法尼亞鐵路]]興建，為[[布雜藝術|布雜藝術]]風格的建築。
其位於[[查爾斯街|查爾斯街]]1515號，約於巴爾的摩市中心與巴爾的摩內港以北1.5英里處。最初由於其為[[賓夕法尼亞鐵路|賓夕法尼亞鐵路]]與[[西馬里蘭鐵路|西馬里蘭鐵路]]共同使用的車站，故稱聯合車站。之後在1928年更名為[[賓夕法尼亞車站|賓夕法尼亞車站]]以與其他性質類似的車站統一命名。

車站主體位於兩條地塹（其一為[[83號州際公路|83號州際公路]]通過，另一為[[Amtrak|Amtrak]]的東北走廊軌道通過）之間的高起地帶。[[Amtrak|Amtrak]]的東北走廊由南方經過[[巴爾的摩與波多馬克隧道|巴爾的摩與波多馬克隧道]]抵達本站。該雙線隧道於1873年啟用，長7660英尺，但其急彎、陡坡、時速30英里的速限，使其成為東北走廊中最嚴重的瓶頸地帶。車站北方東北走廊則經由[[聯合隧道|聯合隧道]]通過，其於1873年啟用，有一單線隧道與一雙線隧道。

'''巴爾的摩賓州車站'''同时也是[[巴爾的摩輕軌|巴爾的摩輕軌]]的車站之一，輕軌紅線列車行駛於本站至[[康登站|康登站]]之間。

本站目前無免費公共停車場，但有550個收費停車位。<ref>http://mta.maryland.gov/marc-parking-details</ref>

本站可轉乘[[美鐵|美鐵]]、[[馬里蘭區域通勤鐵路|馬里蘭區域通勤鐵路]]、馬里蘭運輸局第3、11、61、64路公車，Charm City Circulator免費公車紫線、[[約翰霍普金斯大學|約翰霍普金斯大學]]交通車、閃電巴士（BoltBus）。

雖然巴爾的摩輕軌於巴爾的摩市與巴爾的摩郡的大部分路線是使用以前的[[北方中央鐵路|北方中央鐵路]]的路線，但通往賓州車站的支線卻是例外。賓州車站的輕軌部分在1997年開始營運。

依照每年旅客人次計算，巴爾的摩賓夕法尼亞車站是美國第八繁忙的車站。2012年每天有3301位旅客搭乘[[馬里蘭區域通勤鐵路賓州線|馬里蘭區域通勤鐵路賓州線]]南下。

==歷史==
巴爾的摩賓夕法尼亞車站於1911年9月15日啟用。這是在[[查爾斯街|查爾斯街]]此處的第三個火車站。第一個火車站是[[北方中央鐵路|北方中央鐵路]]的木造車站，於1873年啟用。在1886年該車站改建為三層樓建築的查爾斯街聯合車站，建築主體較街道路面為低，有一斜坡車道通到車站大門與列車車棚（大小為 76 乘 360 英尺，亦即 23.16 乘 109.73 公尺）。<ref>{{cite news |title=Baltimore's Reconstructed Railroad Station Opened 100 Years Ago This Week|first=Frederick N.|last=Rasmussen|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2011-09-11/news/bs-md-backstory-20110911_1_new-station-pennsylvania-station-present-station|newspaper=[[The_Baltimore_Sun|The Baltimore Sun]]|date=September 11, 2011|accessdate=September 11, 2011}}</ref>

舊車站在1910年一月拆除。

==Services==
Penn Station is served by [[Amtrak|Amtrak]], [[MARC_Train|MARC]], and the [[Maryland_Transit_Administration|Maryland Transit Administration]]'s [[Baltimore_Light_Rail|light rail]] system. The station is the northern terminus of the Light Rail's Penn-Camden shuttle, connecting the Mount Vernon neighborhood with downtown; the southern terminus is Baltimore's [[Camden_Station|Camden Station]]. MARC offers service between Washington, D.C., and Perryville, Maryland. Amtrak [[Acela_Express|Acela Express]] and [[Northeast_Regional|Northeast Regional]] trains from Penn Station serve destinations along the Northeast Corridor between [[Boston,_Massachusetts|Boston]] and [[Washington,_D.C|Washington, D.C]]. Some Regional trains from the station continue into [[Virginia|Virginia]] and serve Alexandria, Newport News, Norfolk, Lynchburg, and points in between. Other long-distance trains from the station serve:

*[[St._Albans_(city),_Vermont|St. Albans, Vermont]]
*[[Charlottesville,_Virginia|Charlottesville, Virginia]]
*[[Raleigh,_North_Carolina|Raleigh]] and [[Charlotte,_North_Carolina|Charlotte, North Carolina]]
*[[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]]
*[[New_Orleans|New Orleans, Louisiana]]
*[[Jacksonville,_Florida|Jacksonville]], [[Orlando,_Florida|Orlando]], [[Tampa,_Florida|Tampa]] and [[Miami|Miami, Florida]]
*[[Huntington,_West_Virginia|Huntington, West Virginia]]
*[[Cincinnati|Cincinnati, Ohio]]
*[[Indianapolis|Indianapolis, Indiana]]
*[[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]]

In the 1970s and 1980s, Amtrak also offered service to [[Harrisburg,_Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]] and [[Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], [[St._Louis,_Missouri|St. Louis]], and [[Atlantic_City,_New_Jersey|Atlantic City, New Jersey]].

Before Amtrak's creation on May 1, 1971, Penn Station served as the main Baltimore station for its original owner, the [[Pennsylvania_Railroad|Pennsylvania Railroad]] (PRR), though passenger trains of the [[Western_Maryland_Railway|Western Maryland Railway]] also used Penn Station as well. Until the late 1960s, the PRR also operated long-distance trains over its historic [[Northern_Central_Railway|Northern Central Railway]] line from Penn Station to [[Harrisburg,_Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]] and beyond, such as ''"The General"'' to Chicago, the ''"Spirit of St. Louis"'' to its Missouri namesake, and the ''"Buffalo Day Express"'' and overnight ''"Northern Express"'' between Washington, DC, and [[Buffalo,_New_York|Buffalo, New York]]. As late as 1956, this route also hosted the ''"Liberty Limited"'' to Chicago and the ''"Dominion Limited"'' to [[Toronto|Toronto, Canada]]. The [[Baltimore_Light_Rail|Baltimore Light Rail]] now operates over much of the Northern Central Railway's right of way in Baltimore and Baltimore County; however, the spur connecting Penn Station to this right of way is not the route originally taken by Northern Central trains. Baltimore Light Rail service began in 1997.

As part of the Northeast Corridor Improvement Project, the station was restored to its 1911 appearance in 1984.<ref>{{cite web |title=Amtrak - Baltimore, MD (BAL)|publisher=[http://www.trainweb.org/usarail/baltimore.htm Trainweb]|date=January 2011|url=http://www.trainweb.org/usarail/baltimore.htm|accessdate=January 21, 2011}}</ref>

The station's use as a Western Maryland station stop allowed passengers from Penn Station to ride directly to various Maryland towns such as [[Westminster,_Maryland|Westminster]], [[Hagerstown,_Maryland|Hagerstown]], and [[Cumberland,_Maryland|Cumberland]]. Passenger service on the Western Maryland ended in 1958.

Baltimore Penn Station is also used for MARC train storage during the weekends and overnight via off-peak service times on tracks 2, 3, 5, and 8.

==''Male/Female'' sculpture controversy==
In 2004, the City of Baltimore, through its public arts program, commissioned sculptor [[Jonathan_Borofsky|Jonathan Borofsky]] to create a [[sculpture|sculpture]] as the centerpiece of a re-designed plaza in front of Penn Station. His work, a {{convert|51|ft|m|1|sp=us|adj=on}}-tall aluminum statue entitled ''Male/Female'', has generated considerable controversy ever since. Its defenders cite the contemporary imagery and artistic expression as complementing an urban landscape, while opponents criticize what they decry as a clash with Penn Station's Beaux-Arts architecture, detracting from its classic lines.

As ''[[The_Baltimore_Sun|The Baltimore Sun]]'' editorialized,<ref>{{cite news|title=Art Scrape|newspaper=[[The_Baltimore_Sun|The Baltimore Sun]]|date=August 28, 2006}}</ref> 

{{quote|"Could this explain why defenders of ''"Male/Female"'', the sculpture in front of Penn Station, get so irritable? That large piece of quadrupedal artwork is out there all on its own, unclothed of commemorative armor that might deflect public criticism – unless you want to think of it as a memorial to the war between the sexes, but that's an issue that people tend to have a lot of different and strongly held opinions about anyway. No, ''"Male/Female"'' gets a lot of attention strictly on its artistic merits, and much of it isn't very positive, especially concerning its setting in front of the Beaux–Arts railroad station. This drives its proponents up the wall."}}

Three years later, ''Baltimore Sun'' columnist [[Dan_Rodricks|Dan Rodricks]] ridiculed the artwork, writing on August 26, 2007, "Patrons of art here paid $750,000 for a 51-foot sculpture...that looks like ''[[Gort_(The_Day_the_Earth_Stood_Still)|Gort]]'' from ''[[The_Day_the_Earth_Stood_Still_(1951_film)|The Day the Earth Stood Still]]''. I look at it and want to say: '[[Klaatu_barada_nikto|Klaatu barada nikto]]!' It's the first thing visitors see when they walk out of the train station."<ref>{{cite news |title=Bawlmer Bizarre–What a Relief|first=Dan|last=Rodricks|authorlink=Dan Rodricks|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2007-08-26/news/0708260010_1_don-schaefer-orioles-bizarre|newspaper=[[The_Baltimore_Sun|The Baltimore Sun]]|date=August 26, 2007|accessdate=August 26, 2007|page=3B}}</ref> Another ''Sun'' reporter, commenting in July 2008 on what she described as the "stormy relationship" between Baltimore and public art,  said "People's hate for Penn Station's behemoth ''Male/Female'' sculpture has burned for years."<ref>{{cite news |title=Fake Forest Hides in Plain Sight|first=Jill|last=Rosen|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2008-07-17/features/0807160396_1_sculpture-tree-intersection|newspaper=[[The_Baltimore_Sun|The Baltimore Sun]]|date=July 17, 2008|accessdate=July 17, 2008|page=1C}}</ref>

It has also been featured a few times in the ''[[Zippy_the_Pinhead|Zippy]]'' [[comic_strip|comic strip]], beginning with the August 26, 2004 installment. Its [[cartoonist|cartoonist]] [[Bill_Griffith|Bill Griffith]] opined that "the sculpture as I look at it is both intriguing and compelling but also a little [[kitsch|kitsch]]y, and I like that. It's a nice place to be – high art and low art at the same time." He was also attracted to its message that people are full of contradictions and its provocativeness, stating that "you can't not react to it."<ref>{{cite news |title=Male/Female' Statue Latest Stop on 'Zippy' Trip|first=Edward|last=Gunts|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2004-08-27/features/0408270131_1_zippy-the-pinhead-strip-griffith|newspaper=[[The_Baltimore_Sun|The Baltimore Sun]]|date=August 27, 2004|accessdate=August 27, 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Baltimore Art Crimes: A Charm City Atrocity Exhibit|first=Tom|last=Warner|url=http://accelerateddecrepitude.blogspot.com/2008/03/baltimore-art-crimes.html|work=Accelerated Decrepitude (blog)|date=March 21, 2008|accessdate=March 21, 2008}}</ref>

==Proposed hotel and remodel==
[[Image:Pennsta_int.jpg|left]]  
Several proposals have been made to convert the upper floors of the station in a hotel. In 2001, an agreement was made with James M. Jost & Co. Inc. to convert the upper three floors into a 72-room hotel.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Cohn|first1=Meredith|title=Hotel Planned in Penn Station|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2001-08-09/news/0108090098_1_amtrak-jost-penn-station|accessdate=28 August 2014|work=The Baltimore Sun|date=9 August 2001}}</ref> This project was never completed. The proposal resurfaced in 2006 with a new, unnamed developer.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Mirabella|first1=Lorraine|title=Amtrak revives its plan for hotel at Penn Station|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2006-03-14/business/0603140215_1_amtrak-penn-station-rail-service|accessdate=28 August 2014|work=The Baltimore Sun|date=14 March 2006}}</ref> This proposal was also never completed. In 2009, the idea surfaced once again as Amtrak announced it had reached an agreement with a developer for a 77-room hotel to be called The Inn at Penn Station.<ref>{{cite news |title=Amtrak: Baltimore Penn Station to Hotel|first=Edward|last=Gunts|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/business/bal-amtrak-hotel-0528,0,2999684.story|newspaper=[[The_Baltimore_Sun|The Baltimore Sun]]|date=May 29, 2009|accessdate=May 29, 2009}}</ref> This project was later reported as stalled along with many other hotel proposals in Baltimore.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hotel projects in Baltimore stalled or scrapped|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2010-08-23/business/bs-bz-hotels-unfinished-20100823_1_hotel-projects-budget-hotels-hotel-indigo|accessdate=28 August 2014|work=The Baltimore Sun}}</ref>

==Checkers speech==
During what became known as the [[Checkers_speech|Checkers speech]], on September 23, 1952, [[Richard_Nixon|Richard Nixon]], then a U.S. Senator from California and the Republican Party's nominee for Vice President, cited Penn Station as the place where a package was waiting for him, containing a [[cocker_spaniel|cocker spaniel]] dog his daughter [[Tricia_Nixon_Cox|Tricia]] would name "Checkers." Nixon referred to the station by its former name, "Union Station in Baltimore."
