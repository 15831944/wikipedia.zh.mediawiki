'''律师失职'''（legal malpractice、律師的玩忽職守、瀆職罪）是指因[[律師|律師]]的疏忽、違反信託義務，或違反[[契約|契約]]的期限，因此對客戶造成傷害的行為<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://law.justia.com/cases/california/court-of-appeal/4th/35/1070.html|title=Stanley v. Richmond (1995)|website=Justia Law|access-date=2016-05-26}}</ref>。這種情況發生在當律師以自己的利益行事、而不是履行為客戶利益行事的義務時，並而損害客戶的利益<ref name=":1" />。當律師違反客戶所代表的契約時，也可能會出現律師瀆職的情況。<!--A common basis for a legal malpractice claim arises when an attorney misses a deadline for filing a paper with the court or serving a paper on another party, and that error is irrevocably and incurably fatal to the client's case. 

當律師錯過了向法院提交文件或在另一方提供文件的截止日期時，出現了合法的不當行為索賠的共同基礎，該錯誤對客戶的情況是不可逆轉的，並且是致​​命的。

This situation normally arises with the running of the [[statute_of_limitations|statute of limitations]] (where the client timely reported a potential basis for a lawsuit to the attorney and subsequently authorized its filing, but the attorney failed to timely prepare and file the complaint) 

這種情況通常是由於執行時效法（客戶及時地向受權人提出訴訟的潛在依據，隨後授權其提交，但律師沒有及時準備和提出申訴），

but can also arise in the context of failing to respond to dispositive motions filed by the opponent or failing to timely file a notice of appeal.<ref>{{cite web |title=Legal Malpractice Law and Litigation |url = https://www.expertlaw.com/library/malpractice/legal_malpractice.html |website=Expert Law|publisher=Expertlaw.com|accessdate=24 May 2017 }}</ref>

但也可能出現在沒有對對方提出的決定性動議作出回應或者沒有及時提出上訴通知的情況。

A less common basis is where an attorney misses a deadline and the error, while not fatal in and of itself to a claim or defense, 
較不常見的依據是律師錯過期限和錯誤，而不是索賠或辯護的致命因素，

still forces the client to spend far more to resolve the case than would have been necessary otherwise.<ref>See, e.g., {{cite web|title=In re Kaiser Grp.  Int’l Inc.,  No. 00-02263-MFW (Bankr. D. Del. Aug.  17, 2010).|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6392701043603714793|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=24 May 2017}}</ref>

仍然迫使客戶花更多的錢來解決案件，而不是其他情況。[3]

Under U.S. law, in order to rise to an actionable level of negligence (an actual breach of a legal [[duty_of_care|duty of care]]), the injured party must show that the attorney's acts were not merely the result of poor strategy, but that they were the result of errors that no reasonably prudent attorney would make. While the exact definition varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, typically, the four elements of legal malpractice are (i) an attorney-client relationship, (ii) negligence, (iii) causation, and (iv) financial loss.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.justia.com/injury/legal-malpractice/|title=Legal Malpractice Overview :: Justia|website=www.justia.com|access-date=2016-05-26}}</ref>

To satisfy the third element, legal malpractice requires proof of what would have happened had the attorney not been negligent; that is, "but for" the attorney's negligence ([[sine_qua_non|"but for" causation]]).<ref>''Viner v. Sweet,'' 30 Cal. 4th 1232, 70 P.3d 1046, 135 Cal. Rptr. 2d 629 (2003).</ref> If the same result would have occurred without negligence by the attorney, no [[cause_of_action|cause of action]] will be permitted.  "But for" or actual causation can be difficult to prove.  If the malpractice alleged occurred in litigation, the legal malpractice  case may result in a "trial-within-a-trial" which delves into the facts of the case for which the client originally retained the attorney.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Koffler|first1=Joseph H.|title=Legal Malpractice Damages in a Trial Within a Trial: A Critical Analysis of Unique Concepts: Areas of Unconscionability|journal=Marquette Law Review|year=1989|volume=73|issue=1|page=40|url=http://scholarship.law.marquette.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1727|accessdate=24 May 2017}}</ref>

In at least 11 jurisdictions, a person convicted of a crime who then sues his defense attorney must first prove that he was factually ''innocent'' (in other words, he must first petition for and obtain [[exoneration|exoneration]] from the court that originally convicted him before filing suit) and that he was convicted only because of his attorney's negligence.<ref name=":0">''Wiley v. County of San Diego'', 19 Cal. 4th 532, 966 P.2d 983, 79 Cal. Rptr. 2d 672 (1998).  In this case, the [[Supreme_Court_of_California|Supreme Court of California]] noted that 10 states have already squarely ruled that factual innocence is an essential element of a criminal convict's legal malpractice case against his attorney, and proceeded to join them.  The Court also noted that the exceptions are Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio.</ref>  A plaintiff who has lost a civil case must prove that the legal malpractice complained of caused the case to be lost, so that the plaintiff can then recover from the negligent attorney the damages that would have been owed by the underlying defendant.<ref name=":0" />
