'''腓尼基主義'''（{{lang-ar|نزعة فينيقية}}；{{lang-en|Phoenicianism}}）是{{le|黎巴嫩民族主義|Lebanese nationalism}}的一種形式，在{{Le|大黎巴嫩|Greater Lebanon}}建國之初由以{{le|馬龍尼人|Maronites}}爲首的黎巴嫩基督徒提出<ref name="El-Husseini2012">{{cite book|last=El-Husseini|first=Rola|title=Pax Syriana: Elite Politics in Postwar Lebanon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zgl6DgAVzWMC&pg=PA199|year=2012|publisher=Syracuse University Press|isbn=978-0-8156-3304-4|page=199|quote=Phoenicianism. The "Phoenicianist" discourse of Lebanese identity was adopted by Christian (primarily Maronite) intellectuals at the time of the creation of Greater Lebanon. The Maronites' stated goal of establishing a Christian refuge in the Middle East was instrumental in convincing the French authorities to designate Lebanon as a separate nation-state. The origin myth adopted by the Christian advocates involved a purportedly independent cultural legacy that was said to have existed in Lebanon since ancient times. }}</ref>。這一概念爲[[黎巴嫩人|黎巴嫩人]]與古代腓尼基人之間的聯係提供了支撐。

腓尼基主義認爲，黎巴嫩人（少數情況下特指{{le|黎巴嫩基督教|Christianity in Lebanon|黎巴嫩基督徒}}）并非[[阿拉伯人|阿拉伯人]]，且這一族群有著與周遭中東國家不同的獨特語言和文化。作爲黎巴嫩{{le|民族形成|Ethnogenesis}}理論的一部分，腓尼基主義的支持者認同黎巴嫩人實質上是腓尼基人而非阿拉伯人的後裔。有一些人也主張[[黎凡特阿拉伯語|黎凡特阿拉伯語]]并非[[阿拉伯語變體|阿拉伯語的變體]]，而是{{le|現代亞拉姆語|Neo-Aramaic languages|}}經過發展后形成的獨立語言。其它觀點也有認爲馬龍尼人是[[阿拉米人|阿拉米人]]、[[亞述|亞述人]]或[[馬代特人|馬代特人]]的後代<ref>{{citation|title=Hybridity, Or the Cultural Logic of Globalization|first=Marwan|last=Kraidy|publisher=Temple University Press|year=2005|isbn=978-1-59213-145-7|p=119|quote=Some scholars suggest that the Maronites are the descendants of "the worshippers of Adonis and Astarte," “Assyrians who emerged from Mesopotamia" (Melia, 1986, p. 154). Another theory claims that the Maronites are the descendants of an Arab Bedouin population, the Nabateans, who settled in the Levant during the pre-Christian era (Valognes, 1994, p. 369). A third theory, based on the work of the historian Theophanes, presents the Maronites as the heirs of an Anatolian or Iranian population, the Mardaites, who were allegedly militarily used by the Byzantines against the Arabs because of the Mardaites' outstanding fighting skills (Melia, 1986, p. 158; Nisan, 1992, p. 171; Valognes, 1994, p. 369). According to the fourth and last theory, the Maronites descend from the Phoenicians, a claim held by some Maronite (and other Christian Lebanese) intellectuals as a key building block of their identity, which some scholars dispute (Salibi, 1988; Tabar, 1994; Valognes, 1994), and others support (Gemayel, 1984a, b; Melia, 1986; Nisan, 1992). Chabry and Chabry (1987), among others (Melia, 1986; Nisan, 1992; Tabar, 1994; Valognes, 1994), argue that Maronite claims of a Phoenician heritage are not unfounded (p. 55), because the ethnic makeup of the Maronites is a mixture of Mardaite, Greco-Phoenician, Aramean, Franc, Armenian, and Arab dements (p. 305). In spite of this mixed origin, the Maronites are said to have maintained a presumably unchanging identity - fiercely autonomous from both Muslims and other Christians - remained "untamed in their ways of living and thinking" (Melia, 1986, p. 159; see also Nisan, 1992, p. 171).}}</ref>。[[中東|中東地帶]]存在其它與腓尼基主義相對應的古民族延續理論，例如{{le|亞述人延續說|Assyrian continuity}}與{{le|法老主義|Pharaonism}}<ref>{{citation|title=Hybridity, Or the Cultural Logic of Globalization|first=Marwan|last=Kraidy|publisher=Temple University Press|year=2005|isbn=978-1-59213-145-7|p=119|quote=The Phoenician-roots theory parallels the belief among Copts in Egypt and Nestorians in Iraq, both Christian communities, that they have respectively Pharaonic and ancient Assyrian roots.}}</ref>。此類觀點構成了[[阿拉伯民族主義|阿拉伯民族主義]]和[[泛阿拉伯主義|泛阿拉伯主義]]的對立面。
