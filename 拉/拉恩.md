== 歷史 ==
During the [[18th_century|18th century]] many Irish emigrated to America from the port of Larne. A monument in Curran Park commemorates the ''Friends Goodwill'', the first emigrant ship to sail from Larne in May [[1717|1717]], heading for [[Boston,_Massachusetts|Boston]]. Boston's long standing Irish roots can be traced to Larne, i.e. Notre Dame's 'Fighting Irish' nickname. As with  Western and Southern Ireland, Larne, unlike some ares of North East(Antrim, Down, Louth and North Dublin) and Eastern Ireland (South Dublin, Wicklow) was hugely affected by the [[Irish_Famine|Irish Famine]] of the mid 19th century.

==Transport==
Ferries sail from the harbour to destinations including [[Cairnryan|Cairnryan]] and [[Troon|Troon]] in [[Scotland|Scotland]], and [[Fleetwood|Fleetwood]] in [[England|England]].

Larne is connected to [[Belfast|Belfast]] by the [[A8_road_(Northern_Ireland)|A8]] [[roads_in_Ireland|road]]. The [[A2_road_(Northern_Ireland)|A2 road]] or 'Antrim coast road' which runs along the Antrim coast, and passes through the scenic [[Glens_of_Antrim|Glens of Antrim]], also serves the town. South of the town the A2 passes the side of [[Larne_Lough|Larne Lough]], via [[Glynn|Glynn]], [[Magheramorne|Magheramorne]], and [[Ballycarry|Ballycarry]], to [[Whitehead|Whitehead]] and [[Carrickfergus|Carrickfergus]]. The [[A36_road_(Northern_Ireland)|A36 road]] runs from the town to [[Ballymena|Ballymena]].

A railway route to Belfast, via Whitehead and Carrickfergus, also connects Larne to the [[Northern_Ireland_Railways|Northern Ireland Railways]] [[rail_transport_in_Ireland|network]]. Currently there is no freight transport by rail in Northern Ireland.
