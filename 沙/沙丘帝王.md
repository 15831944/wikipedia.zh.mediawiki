'''沙丘帝王（God Emperor of Dune）'''是[[弗兰克·赫伯特|弗兰克·赫伯特]]的一部[[科幻小说|科幻小说]] —''[[沙丘|沙丘]]''系列小说的第四部。

[[保罗·亚崔迪|保罗·亚崔迪]]成为[[弗瑞曼人|弗瑞曼人]]的[[弥赛亚|弥赛亚]]和宇宙的皇帝之后，3500年过去了。他的儿子，[[莱托·亚崔迪二世|莱托]]，看到他父亲穆哈迪也曾看到的道路，一个避免人类灭绝的未来之路。但是，这个未来需要巨大的无私奉献，要承受从人到沙虫的重生。莱托二世接受[[弗瑞曼人|弗瑞曼人]]的神的头衔，并开始将自己变成[[沙漠|沙漠]]的猛兽，[[沙虫|沙虫]]，它统治了沙丘数千年的生态。莱托，现在放心他的[[黄金之路|黄金之路]]— 人类的幸存被保证的未来之路—已经很安全了，于是开始寻求将自己从黄金之路上除去的机会，也就是死去的机会。


==故事梗概==
小说《沙丘帝王》将我们置于一个和《[[沙丘之子|沙丘之子]]》大不相同的宇宙中。[[莱托·亚崔迪二世|莱托·亚崔迪二世]]还活着，他统治帝国已经三千多年了，他的寿命是因为莱托在赫伯特在前著中所作的将自己的人体和[[沙鲑|沙鲑]]合为一体的决定造成的。莱托继续向沙虫演变着，他唯一剩下的人类特点就是他的脸和双手，嵌在道服般的虫身中。莱托的双腿不过就是无用的鳍肢。他用一辆装备了轮子和悬浮器象[[坦克|坦克]]底盘一样的巨大的机械车来维持行动。在《沙丘之子》中，莱托二世是主角，骄傲地继承了沙丘的统治权，是穆哈迪的神谕权利的传人，以及带领人类沿着无止境的时间表前进的有远见的领袖。但是三千年让莱托不仅在身体上也在道德上伦理上发生了演变，他的神的身份引出了一系列关于他的统治的合法性的问题。莱托的统治也导致了对他的人性和他作为善、恶、必要性和道德专制的疑问。

小说从一个致命的追击开始：一队反叛的人类被一群称为D-狼的嗜杀的改基因狼随追杀。狼群一个一个的消灭了从莱托的哨所中成功偷取了一些文件的叛军。当我们看到追击时，只剩三个叛军还在逃跑。狼群很快击倒了其中的一个，迫使第二个受伤痛所扰的逃跑者勇敢的留下来试图给最后一个逃跑着宝贵的一两分钟。最后一个人，用尽她的全力安全的到达了埃达荷河的彼岸；从这个安全的地点－[[赛欧娜·亚崔迪|赛欧娜]]－回头看着岸上的狼，诅咒着阿拉吉斯的皇帝，这个诅咒很有意义，因为我们知道，她和莱托一样，姓亚崔迪。

<!--
[[邓肯·爱达荷|邓肯·爱达荷]]的存在是评价莱托的权威和他对人类进化的设计的参考点。为了减轻数世纪的孤独，莱托要求特雷亚拉克斯人制造邓肯的[[再造人|再造人]]作为他的伙伴以及他的纯女性鱼语者军队的领袖。在和邓肯的激烈讨论中，预先得到[[宇航公会|宇航公会]]警告的莱托知道邓肯带了一把从[[第九行星人|第九行星人]]那里购买的激光枪并预谋刺杀自己。莱托并未感到震惊；我们可以知道最后几乎所有邓肯的再造人都反叛了莱托，因为无法掌握黄金之路的目的，不能理解莱托的所作所为的原因，他们只记得亚崔迪过去是如何统治的，并以此为标准反对邓肯眼中莱托的暴政。作为亚崔迪家族的剑术大师，保罗的老师和密友，以及亚崔迪的忠实追随者，作者探查了邓肯的内心冲突和挣扎，以此作为这个未来世界的一个立足点。Duncan, disdainfully referred to as an older model by Moneo during an altercation, represents social mores and virtues of the past and their incompatibility with the immediate needs of the present, but more poignantly, their mutual exclusivity with Leto's Golden Path.  Herbert expounds on these concepts in an exchange between Leto and Duncan with the two discussing the failures of aristocratic and ruling classes.

Despite being armed with the intent to kill Leto, Duncan's judgement of Leto requires further justification. During his meeting with Leto, Duncan acts as if nothing is unnatural, as if it was nothing more than a normal meeting between the two of them. In the midst of the meeting, we learn that the rebels have escaped with some of Leto's personal diaries and a map to his citadel. Leto II lapses into daydreams during the conversation, and Duncan takes this chance to try and kill him. However, Leto reacts faster than any human could, leaping instinctively in the air and crushing Duncan with his body, almost before Duncan gets off a shot. Leto is barely injured, losing only a seemingly unnecessary flipper in the process. The flipper is an important symbol, however, because it used to be one of his legs, and the fact that it was destroyed distances Leto still further from the human that he once was. 

[[Moneo_Atreides|Moneo]], Leto's chief minister, is called in to arrange the disposal of Duncan. Moneo, we learn, had seen similar scenes before and is mostly bothered by how it will affect the routine of government. To make our moral quandaries even more confusing we discover that loyal Moneo is the worried father of the rebellious Siona. During their conversation about her, we discover that Siona is in some way vital to Leto's plans. 

We have, however, not seen the end of Duncan Idaho. The Tleilaxu were aware of Duncan's plans and send along a new Idaho before the previous version has even died. The latest Duncan is met by two members of Leto's personal guard (called [[Fish_Speakers|Fish Speakers]]). They, being used to the arrival of Duncan, tell him as much as he needs to know and as little as Leto wants him to know, to best prepare him for his meeting with the God Emperor. Duncan is unsettled, not only by the fact he learns he has been brought back into a world three thousand years after his own, but also by the Fish Speakers. The fact they are female military offends Duncan's sensibilities, but in addition he can see that they have been heavily conditioned to obey without question, which is opposed to the original Atreides ideal. 

The rebels on [[Arrakis|Arrakis]] give the encrypted diaries of Leto to the Ixian ambassador in a secret meeting. The Ixian ambassador mocks Siona for her disguise, asking why she bothers when it is well known she is the leader of the rebels. He goes on to mock her 'rebellion' by asking her when she intends to join the God Emperor, since one generation after another the young Atreides have 'played' at being rebels before being called into the loyal service of Leto. But Siona turns the tables on him by threatening blackmail. Also at the end of the meeting Siona unmasks a spy, sending him back to Leto with a message. Ironically, however, the spy is actually her father's, and it is Siona's closest companion, [[Nayla|Nayla]], who is Leto's true spy. 

Moneo and Leto meet again and we learn that the new Duncan is untainted by the [[Bene_Tleilax|Bene Tleilax]]. In the past, the Bene Tleilax had attempted genetic tampering; to which Leto had responded with violent sanctions. Moneo and Leto discuss Leto's human breeding programme, which he had taken from the [[Bene_Gesserit|Bene Gesserit]], much to their disquiet. We also learn that Duncan Idaho has played an important role in this programme and that, in Leto's own words, he rather strangely sees himself as a predator on humanity, a concept that Moneo fails to understand, much to Leto's disappointment. Moneo also raises his fears about his daughter, which Leto sympathises with, but says that she must be tested and that Moneo should trust in his daughter's capabilities. 

Later, Leto meets Nayla Nycalliste, his spy in Siona's camp. This is a very disquieting meeting, because we discover that Nayla is a complete fanatic, and utterly devoted to Leto, taking his title of God Emperor utterly literally. He orders her, for unknown reasons, to obey every command of Siona. During their conversation we learn from Nayla that Siona is ready for testing, a fact Leto was unsure of, because she isn't always visible to his prophetic dreams. We do learn, in Leto's favour, that he is not proud of his accomplishment with Nayla, and regrets the necessity of such religious conditioning. 

Leto initially meets Duncan in a darkened room so Duncan can gradually become adjusted to him. Leto begins the conversation using Paul Atreides' voice, in order to calm Duncan down. He first tells Duncan that it was a face dancer pretending to be Paul who triggered Duncan's memories, rather than a ghola version. Leto then goes on to confirm the things that the Tleilaxu had told Duncan were true — that he was turning into a worm, that it was three thousand years later, that Leto has brought Duncan back many times, etc. Once he calms Duncan's near hysteria, he changes over to his real voice, and switches on the light so Duncan can see him as he really is. He explains why he has done what he has done; he then reveals that he needs Duncan to command his army. Duncan then gets sidetracked by his chauvinism into asking why Leto has an all female army; Leto gives the short answer that they minimize the level of violence. After having his doubts about the religious mantle Leto has taken on mollified, Duncan swears into Leto's service with the caveat that if he is worse than [[Baron_Vladimir_Harkonnen|Baron Vladimir Harkonnen]] then he will turn against him. It is disquieting to discover that Leto is amused that the Baron is Duncan's measure of true evil.

The next day Moneo and Duncan talk. Duncan returns to the subject of his doubts — the female army and the religion Leto has created. They first discuss Leto's ideas about the value of a female army, that basically unless really well disciplined the male army is essentially rapist and a threat to its own population. Duncan is forced to reluctantly accept these arguments when he examines his own personal experience. During the conversation Duncan learns that Moneo is an Atreides and also a descendant of previous Duncan Idaho gholas, that Leto had taken over the Bene Gesserit breeding programme. Duncan also questions Moneo about the 'god business' and is shocked and pleased that Moneo makes no attempt to defend it and says in point of fact that Leto himself calls it a 'Holy Obscenity.' 

We are then introduced to [[Anteac|Anteac]] and Luyseyal, [[Reverend_Mother_(Dune)|Reverend Mothers]], who have come to Arrakis to represent the [[Bene_Gesserit|Bene Gesserit]]; they are disquieted by their poor accommodation, and thus, lack of favour in the eye of the God Emperor. They learn that the Ixian embassy has been overtaken by face dancers and that an attack is planned on the God Emperor that day and try to warn Leto. 

However, the Bene Gesserit do not reach the God Emperor in time and so while the God Emperor is traveling between cities, the Emperor's convoy is attacked by Face Dancers who try to confuse the Fish Speaker guards by imitating Duncan Idaho. Duncan, however, foils their plan by stripping himself of his clothes and the unprepared Face Dancers are unable to copy him, allowing the Fish Speakers to easily slaughter them. The God Emperor tells his guards to hide all evidence of the battle, so the Tleilaxu will think that their attack didn't even inflict a single casualty. 

The Ixians send [[Hwi_Noree|Hwi Noree]] as their new ambassador to Leto, and he is immediately attracted to her. She is a highly empathic and intelligent woman, who has greatly admired Leto from afar and almost immediately understands him. She is exactly the kind of woman that Leto would have wanted as a mate if he were still truly human. He is aware that she quite obviously is some kind of Ixian trap, since obviously someone must have deliberately created and trained her to be such a perfect fit for him, but he cannot resist the pleasure of her company even so. As such, she is a kind of delicious agony for him because his sexual organs have long since disappeared. Furthermore, he possessed no foreknowledge of her, which meant that somehow the Ixians had managed to hide her existence from his prophetic dreams. 

In the meantime on Leto's orders a masked Nayla publicly flogs the Tleilaxu ambassador until he passes out.

The Bene Gesserit are in the God Emperor's good graces for attempting to warn him of the attack on his convoy and retain his good`will even though they bring concentrated spice essence with them in the hope of triggering his transition to a worm. In fact, this attempt on his life amuses him because it is so unusual; and so he treats this attack as a gift, offering himself as an oracle as a reward. Of the two Bene Gesserit, Leto is insulted at the naivety of Luylesal but is impressed by the abilities of the other, Anteac, and, semi-jokingly, offers her a job working for him. 

Leto decides that Siona has been left independent for long enough and so sends his Fish Speakers to induct her into his service. She does not enter his service willingly and is in fact guarded at all times. Leto intends to breed Siona with Duncan Idaho, and so he arranges for them to go on a trip together expecting that things will happen naturally sooner or later. Siona, angered by this, decides to take Duncan to Goygoa village, which was once called Jacurutu, where the young Leto II made his headquarters in remote past centuries. This is a cruel decision by Siona, because Duncan is stared at as soon as he arrives in the village and is unpleasantly surprised to be confronted by a local boy, who he learns was fathered by the previous Duncan Idaho. Unable to resist the temptation, he identifies the mother of the child, and immediately see her resemblance to [[Jessica_Atreides|Jessica Atreides]]. Roomed together by the Fish Speakers, Siona and Duncan swap insults in their irritation at Leto's breeding plans for them both; but decline any further intimacy. 

When he returns Duncan is introduced to the [[Siaynoq|Siaynoq]], the major religious ceremony of the Fish Speakers during which they celebrate their unique relationship with the God Emperor. Duncan witnesses it firsthand and is stunned by the power of it. During the ceremony Duncan reswears his allegiance to the Atreides, though not directly to Leto. The whole experience does little to ease Duncan's doubts. 

Hwi Noree and Leto meet for the second time. Hwi Noree is hurriedly called to audience with Leto. When she arrives, she learns that her embassy had been overrun by face dancers and the only reason she had survived was because they needed the time to perfect their mimicking of her in order to fool the God Emperor. Shocked by this, she wonders why the God Emperor hadn't wiped out the Face Dancers. He answers that they have their uses and that the only political group Leto had ever actually considered destroying were the Bene Gesserit; because they are so near to what they should be, yet so far. Finally he asks her to be his bride, though he 'reassures' her that he is incapable of being her physical lover; he tells her that she can have children with a discreet lover of his choosing if she so wishes. 

Duncan and Leto talk again; Duncan is still filled with doubts and confusion, and he doesn't understand the shape of Leto's empire. Leto laughs at this, and says that realising one doesn't know something is the first step to understanding. Leto then explains more about his Empire; he tells Duncan that he has no prisons because breaking the law in his Empire is a religious crime and thus punishable with death, which does not make Duncan feel any better because he realizes that Leto is the leader of a group that is judge, jury, and executioner. At the conclusion of the conversation, Duncan tells Leto that he will not worship him, to which Leto remarks that the Fish Speakers understand that he has special dispensation. 

Moneo meets with Leto with news. He first suggests that Anteac is a secret [[mentat|mentat]], a skill prohibited in the Empire. Leto agrees, but says that it amuses him. Moneo goes onto say that they have pressured the Bene Tleilaxu into giving him information about Hwi Noree. The Bene Tleilaxu played a role in her birth, by supplying the Ixians with technology to do a cellular restructuring. Leto suggests that it is interesting that Hwi Noree seems the total opposite in character to Malky, the previous Ixian ambassador, with whom Leto once had a close friendship.  Malky was  crafted by the Ixians as a being of pure cynicism and amorality. 

Hwi Noree and Leto talk again. Leto explains the shape of his Empire and what he is trying to produce; he talks about how in human affairs each cycle is a reaction to the previous cycle. He explains what will happen when he goes into the sands and his empire falls apart. Basically, he believes that the process will make humankind more mature, through being confronted by the same desperate experience of the disasters his death will cause. Hwi Noree, unlike Moneo and the Duncans, understands what Leto means, which pleases Leto greatly. At the end of the audience Leto asks her if she has given any thought to his proposal, and she answers that she has chosen to marry him. 

Upon leaving Leto, Hwi goes to see Anteac and shares her knowledge of the environment in which she was brought up. Anteac has been conscripted by Leto to lead a Fish Speaker assault on Ix, to wrest the secret of Hwi's origins. Anteac is shocked at the knowledge that Hwi is to marry Leto and at the same time annoyed that her order had allowed such a talented woman to pass through their training programme without turning her into a Bene Gesserit. 

Later, the city of Onn rises in rebellion against Leto; Leto is completely surprised, which is interesting in itself. The rebels attack the Ixian embassy, which, because of the threat to Hwi, sends Leto into a rage;  he leaps out of his cart, and attacks the rebels. The Fish Speakers, using the confusion and panic his assault causes, wipe out the rebels. Regaining his calm upon discovering Hwi is safe, Leto regrets his intervention because he has created a new dependency among his Fish Speakers; now they know that he awaits in the wings, a seemingly invincible death machine. Leto realizes it will take generations to erase this dependency. Leto also realizes that this attack must have been planned by Malky, hidden away within the Ixian device that protects people from his vision. 

The announcement that Leto is marrying Hwi Noree upsets Moneo immensely; he believes the wedding will bring Leto's enemies in alliance against him. Moneo asks Leto for an explanation for why Leto must do this; Leto tells him that it is because of emotions, that Hwi provokes glorious emotions within him that he had long thought he had lost, restoring his sense of humanity. During the conversation we learn more about Moneo's abilities and limits; Leto tries to raise Moneo's level of awareness but ultimately fails. Moneo's idea of himself limits him from being all he could be. 

After the frustration of having to deal with Moneo, Leto answers Duncan's calls for audience. Duncan, Leto realizes, is suffering from what he calls 'Since Syndrome', something which happens to most gholas, but with this one had happened much earlier than ever before. Duncan feels out of sync with this time and place. Duncan is also upset by the news that Leto is marrying Hwi, a woman he finds intensely attractive also; Leto orders him not to spend time with her. 

Some time later Moneo and Leto discuss Duncan. Leto is irritated that Duncan is courting Hwi Noree. However, Moneo informs him that it is Hwi Noree herself who is initiating the meetings; he says that Hwi feels a great deal of sympathy for Duncan because he is so out of his time and place. But this does not calm Leto because he says Duncan is very clever with women. Leto asks when a new Duncan ghola can be provided by the Tleilaxu; Moneo says that the Tleilaxu claim they are having problems and that it will be a year. In response, Leto orders that his marriage to Hwi be hurried along. 

Leto meets with Siona to assess her readiness for the testing. They talk about many subjects, including his worm body, and the state of his Empire. She points out that his position is much weaker now, because of his reaction to the attack on the Ixian embassy, people now realize that he is vulnerable to attacks on the people he loves. She goes on to question his right to rule which is the root of her rebelliousness. His response is that he rules by right of loneliness and sacrifice. This puts Siona on the defensive, because she had never considered that Leto might have any rights as a consequence of his uniqueness. 

Moneo and Duncan talk. Moneo tries to get Duncan to call off his pursuit of Hwi Noree. The conversation becomes very heated and Duncan says a number of critical things about the [[Leto_II|God Emperor]], within the hearing of Fish Speakers. When Duncan finally returns to his room he finds Hwi waiting for him. She had been told of his latest outbursts by some sympathetic Fish Speakers and had rushed to calm him down. However, things do not get any calmer. Hwi says that she was produced to seduce the God Emperor, to seduce an Atreides, and that he, Duncan, is as much the Atreides ideal as any. In the heat of the emotional interchange, Hwi Noree and Duncan have passionate sex. But to Duncan's great disappointment she tells him afterwards that she's still going to marry the God Emperor. When Duncan asks why, she says it is because he has the greatest needs of the two of them, the greatest need in all the Empire. 

Siona is tested in the deep desert by Leto. She is forced to drink Spice Essence from Leto's body which sends her into a spice trance and into [[prescience|prophetic dreaming]]. In her dreams she sees [[Arafel|Arafel]], she sees the various possibilities in the human future, and more importantly how in all futures visible to prescient vision, humans are hunted and killed to the last person by deadly, evolving [[machine|machine]]s; it is implied later that these machines were built by the [[Ixians|Ixians]]. The solution, Leto shows her, is that humans need to escape the prescient trap; which is where Siona's own genes (which render her invisible and unpredictable by prescience) come in, and also the no-ships and the repression of peoples in the Old Empire. All these things make up Leto's Golden Path, which she realizes is the only way out.

Duncan and Moneo meet. Duncan wants to know where Leto is, Moneo explains he is in the desert with his daughter. Duncan is also upset when he discovered that the some of the Fish Speakers are [[lesbians|lesbians]].  Moneo's grows impatient at Duncan's 'puerile' questions and treats him in an offhand way. The conversation goes from bad to worse and he accuses Duncan of not having the courage to fulfill Leto's expectations, Duncan is enraged by Moneo's comments and attempts to strike him a blow; but, to his utter surprise, Moneo not only avoids the blow, but with amazing quickness hurls Idaho to the floor. Idaho looks up in shock, 'How?' is all he can say; and the [[angry|angry]] Moneo utters words he later regrets 'Leto has been breeding us for generations. You're just an older model.' Duncan upset beyond words, retires to his rooms in shock. 

After a day of contemplation, Duncan's soul searching is interrupted by a Fish Speaker relaying Moneo's requests for Duncan's presence, Duncan is uninterested until he is told Hwi is there. On his arrival it is clear that they have been discussing him before he arrives. They are both worried by the fact that the warrior Duncan arrives without his knife. Moneo apologises for his actions and words in front of Hwi Noree, Duncan takes this well and apologises himself; Duncan experiences a weird feeling that only Moneo, Hwi, and himself are the only real humans in existence. Duncan asks about Siona's experience in the desert, Moneo explains his experience and explains that the reason he serves Leto so faithfully is that after seeing the prophetic visions he is relieved that he never had to make the decision Leto made to become a worm and is free just to serve. Duncan seems unconvinced by this argument and indeed flies into a rage at the fact that he and Hwi cannot see each other, this exasperates Hwi and Moneo; but as Duncan leaves we realize that for once his actions do not reflect his true feelings, and that he had deliberately made himself pathetic for Hwi's sake, so that she can be happier in her choice to put Leto first. 

Duncan and Moneo meet later; and we discover Moneo's relief at his daughter's survival. To Moneo's surprise, Duncan asks a very un-Duncan question: 'What was it the other Duncan Idaho's didn't learn?', Moneo answers him that they did not learn how to trust. Duncan is shocked by this comment in turn, since he has always considers himself to be a man who trusts others; Moneo responds that the circle of his fellowship is too limited — it includes only fellow warriors and women who complement his sense of himself. After this conversation Moneo decides to try and save Duncan by sending him and Siona away to Tuono Village, for the duration of the wedding. 

When Leto learns of this, he is amused that Moneo is attempting to save Idaho and changes the location of his wedding to Tuono. Malky has been captured by the Fish Speakers, though Anteac died capturing him. When Leto moved against Ixians, Bene Gesserit and Bene Tleilaxu struck just before in order to steal the secret of the device, the secret of the Ixian device has been scattered far and wide. Malky is escorted into Leto's presence, Malky and Leto talk about old and new times. At the end of this conversation, Moneo does what Leto cannot and kills Leto's friend at Leto's behest. Leto and his convoy set off to Tuono village. 

Duncan and Siona talk at Tuono village after a difficult start; and realize that they both still believe that the God Emperor needs to be killed, and overthrown. They both realize that he can be killed by water and hatch a desperate plan to kill the God Emperor. Idaho climbs a high cliff by himself without ropes, using the experience he learned in his youth. From there he lowers a rope down for Siona and Nayla. From the cliff they await the arrival of Leto's convoy.  When the convoy does arrive, Siona orders Nayla to fire her lasgun at the bridge and Nayla, having been directly ordered by Leto to obey Siona's every order, obeys, fully expecting it to be a religious test of Leto's and expecting him to perform a miracle. The shot shatters the bridge and Moneo, Hwi Noree, Leto and the rest of the convoy is hurled into the water. Leto escapes to the shore, but, as his death is nigh, the sandtrout desert his dying body into the sands, leading to the fulfillment of his prophecy about the resurgence of sandworms on Arrakis. Duncan is distraught that Nayla has killed Hwi, and kills the utterly shocked Nayla. Leto leaves Duncan and Siona [[stewardship|stewardship]] of his Empire by telling them where he has hidden his spice reserves before he breathes his last.

==Notable Parody==
In an episode ([[Mandy_the_Merciless_/_Creating_Chaos_/_Really_Odd_Couple|Mandy the Merciless]]) of the cartoon [[The_Grim_Adventures_of_Billy_and_Mandy|The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy]], the characters look into the future on a boring day, a future which is an obvious spoof of ''God Emperor of Dune.'' Mandy, like Leto, has taken on a large worm form that has granted her an extremely long life. She controls the world with her "cinnamon mines," which plays much the same role as Spice. Through the ages, Mandy has been kept company by clones of her friend Billy, much like Leto was by Duncan Idaho. The Grim Reaper plays a role of both Mandy's attendant (like Moneo) and a rebel (like Siona). Billy, like Duncan, joins the plot to destroy Mandy. However, Mandy easily crushes this rebellion (by using Billy as a dupe). When asked how she uncovered the rebellion's secret, we find that she learned it millennia ago, on the boring day when she looked into the future and saw what would happen, an obvious reference to Leto's prescience.
