{{发音方法}}

'''闪音'''［{{lang|en|Flap}}，也称'''弹音'''（{{lang|en|tap}}）］是[[发音方法|发音方法]]之一，属于[[辅音|辅音]]。发音时，[[舌|舌]]尖向上卷起，但不直接接触[[齿|齿]][[牙龈|龈]]或者上[[腭|颚]]。气流冲出时，舌尖轻微闪颤一下，与齿龈或上颚接触，瞬间即离开。

[[日语|日语]]的"r-"（ら行）以及[[韓語|韓語]]{{lang|ko|ㄹ}}作初聲時也是[[齿龈边闪音|齿龈边闪音]]。

<!-- ===Retroflex flaps===
Most [[Indic_language|Indic]] and [[Dravidian_languages|Dravidian languages]] have retroflex flaps. In [[Hindi|Hindi]] there are three, a simple retroflex flap as in {{IPA|[bɐɽɑː]}} ''big,'' a [[breathy_voice|murmured]] retroflex flap as in {{IPA|[koɽʱiː]}} ''leper,'' and a retroflex [[nasalization|nasal]] flap in the Hindicized pronunciation of [[Sanskrit|Sanskrit]] {{IPA|[mɐɽ̃i]}} ''ruby.'' Some of these may be [[allophone|allophonic]].

A retroflex flap is also common in [[Norwegian_dialects#Retroflex_"R"|Norwegian dialects]] and some [[Swedish_dialects|Swedish dialects]].

===Lateral flaps===
Lateral flaps may be more common than much of the literature would lead one to believe. Many of the languages of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific that don't distinguish [r] from [l] may have a lateral flap, but this is generally missed by European linguists, who often aren't familiar with the sound.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

However, it is also possible that many of these languages do not have a lateral-central contrast at all, so that even a consistently neutral articulation may be perceived as sometimes lateral {{IPA|[ɺ]}} or {{IPA|[l]}}, sometimes central {{IPA|[ɾ]}}. This has been suggested to be the case for [[Japanese_language|Japanese]], for example. 

The [[Iwaidja_language|Iwaidja language]] of Australia has both alveolar and [[retroflex_lateral_flap|retroflex lateral flap]]s. These contrast with [[lateral_approximant|lateral approximant]]s at the same positions, as well as a retroflex tap {{IPA|[ɽ]}}, [[alveolar_tap|alveolar tap]] {{IPA|[ɾ]}}, and [[retroflex_approximant|retroflex approximant]] {{IPA|[ɻ]}}. However, the flapped, or tapped, laterals in Iwaidja are distinct from 'lateral flaps' as represented by the corresponding IPA symbols (see below). These phones consist of a flap component followed by a lateral component, whereas In Iwaidja the opposite is the case. For this reason, current IPA transcriptions of these sounds by linguists working on the language consist of an alveolar lateral followed by a superscript alveolar tap and a retroflex lateral followed by a superscript retroflex tap.

A [[velar_lateral_flap|velar lateral flap]] may exist as an allophone in a few languages of New Guinea.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

The retroflex lateral flap does not have an officially recognized symbol in the IPA. However, an ''ad hoc'' symbol based on the alveolar lateral flap may occasionally be seen:

[[Image:Lateral_flaps.png|Image:Lateral flaps.png]]

Such derived symbols are becoming more frequent now that font-editing software is widely accessible. Note that besides not being sanctioned by the IPA, there is no [[Unicode|Unicode]] value for it. However, the retroflex lateral flap may be written in Unicode-compliant fashion as a digraph of the alveolar lateral flap {{IPA|[ɺ]}} with the right-tail diacritic, {{IPA|[ɺ̢]}}. 

The palatal and velar lateral flaps may be represented with a short diacritic over the letter for the homorganic approximant, although the diacritic would need to appear under the palatal due to its ascender: {{IPA|[ʎ̯, ʟ̆]}}.

===Non-coronal flaps===

The only common non-[[coronal_consonant|coronal]] flap is the [[labiodental_flap|labiodental flap]], found throughout central Africa in languages such as [[Margi_language|Margi]]. In 2005, the IPA adopted a right-hook v,

:[[Image:Labiodental_flap_(Gentium).svg|30px]]

for this sound. (Supported by some fonts: {{IPA|[ⱱ]}}.) Previously, it had been transcribed with the use of the breve diacritic, {{IPA|[v̆]}}, or other ''ad hoc'' symbols. 

Other flaps are much less common. They include a [[bilabial_flap|bilabial flap]] in [[Banda_languages|Banda]], which may be an [[allophone|allophone]] of the labiodental flap, and a [[velar_lateral_flap|velar lateral flap]] as an allophone in [[Kanite_language|Kanite]] and [[Melpa_language|Melpa]]. These are often transcribed with the breve diacritic, as {{IPA|[w̆, ʟ̆]}}. Note here that, like a velar [[trill_consonant|trill]], a central velar flap or tap is not possible because the tongue and [[soft_palate|soft palate]] cannot move together easily enough to produce a sound.

If other flaps are found, the breve diacritic could be used to represent them, but would more properly be combined with the symbol for the corresponding voiced stop. A [[palatal_consonant|palatal]] or [[uvular_consonant|uvular]] flap, which unlike a velar flap is believed to be articulatorily possible, could be represented this way (by {{IPA|*[ɟ̆, ɢ̆~ʀ̆]}}).

===Nasal flaps===
[[Nasal_consonant|Nasal consonant]]s include flaps, although these are rarely phonemic. Many West African languages have a nasal flap {{IPA|[ɾ̃]}} (or {{IPA|[n̆]}}) as an allophone of {{IPA|/ɾ/}} before a nasal vowel; [[Pashto_language|Pashto]], however, has a phonemic nasal [[retroflex_lateral_flap|retroflex lateral flap]]. -->
