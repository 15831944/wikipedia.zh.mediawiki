'''以撒·華茲'''（{{lang|en|'''Isaac Watts'''}}，{{bd|1674年|7月17日|1748年|11月25日|catIdx=W}}）是英国17世纪一位多产的[[圣诗|圣诗]]作者，一生创作了大约750首圣诗，被称为“英文圣诗之父”。他的许多圣诗至今仍被广泛传唱，并且已经被翻译成许多种语言。

== 生平 ==

以撒·華茲出生在[[南安普敦|南安普敦]]一个非国教徒的家庭，父亲是一个独立教会（[[公理会|公理会]]）的[[执事|执事]]，曾经两次由於其信仰特点被关进监狱。他在学校学习[[拉丁文|拉丁文]]、[[希腊文|希腊文]]和[[希伯来文|希伯来文]]。他在家时已经表现出作诗的天赋，<!-- driving his parents to the point of distraction on many occasions with his verse.  Once, he had to explain how he came to have his eyes open during prayers. -->

<!-- : ''"A little mouse for want of stairs''
: ''ran up a rope to say its prayers."''

Receiving corporal punishment for this, he cried

: ''"O father, do some pity take''
: ''And I will no more verses make."'' -->

<!-- Watts, unable to go to either [[牛津大学|牛津大学]] or [[剑桥大学|剑桥大学]] due to his Nonconformity, went to the [[Dissenting_Academy|Dissenting Academy]] at [[Stoke_Newington|Stoke Newington]] in [[1690|1690]].

His education led him to the pastorate of a large Independent Chapel in [[London|London]], and he also found himself in the position of helping trainee preachers, despite poor health. Taking work as a private tutor, he lived with the nonconformist Hartopp family at Fleetwood House, Abney Park in Stoke Newington, and later became part of the household of Sir Thomas Abney at Theobalds in Hertfordshire whose children he taught. Though a nonconformist, Sir Thomas practiced occasional conformity to the Church of England as necessitated by his being Lord Mayor of London 1700–01. Likewise Isaac Watts held religious opinions that were more nondenominational or ecumenical than was at that time common for a nonconformist; having a greater interest in promoting education and scholarship, than preaching for any particular ministry.  

On the death of Sir Thomas Abney, Watts moved permanently with [[Lady_Mary_Abney|Lady Mary Abney]] and her remaining daughter to their second home, Abney House, at Abney Park in Stoke Newington, a property that Lady Mary had inherited from her brother along with title to the Manor itself. The beautiful grounds at [[Abney_Park|Abney Park]], which became Watts' permanent home from 1736 to 1748, led down to an island heronry in the Hackney Brook where Watts sought inspiration for the many books and hymns written during these two decades. He died there in [[Stoke_Newington|Stoke Newington]] and was buried in [[Bunhill_Fields|Bunhill Fields]], having left behind him a massive legacy, not only of hymns, but also of treatises, educational works, essays and the like. His work was influential amongst independents and early religious revivalists in his circle, amongst whom was [[Philip_Doddridge|Philip Doddridge]] who dedicated his best known work to Watts. On his death, Isaac Watts' papers were given to [[耶鲁大学|耶鲁大学]]; an institution with which he was connected due to its being founded predominantly by fellow Independents (Congregationalists). --> 

<!-- *One of his best known poems was an exhortation "[[Against_Idleness_And_Mischief|Against Idleness And Mischief]]" in ''Divine Songs for Children'', a poem which was famously parodied by [[Lewis_Carroll|Lewis Carroll]] in his book ''[[Alice's_Adventures_in_Wonderland|Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'', in the poem "[[How_Doth_the_Little_Crocodile|How Doth the Little Crocodile]]," which is now better known than the original.

*In the 1884 [[comic_opera|comic opera]] called ''[[Princess_Ida|Princess Ida]]'', there is a punning reference to Watts in Act I.  At Princess Ida's women's university no males of any kind are allowed, and the Princess's father, King Gama, relates that "She'll scarcely suffer Dr. Watt's 'hymns'". -->

== 其他作品 ==

除了是一位伟大的圣诗作者以外，以撒·華茲也是一位[[神学家|神学家]]和[[逻辑学家|逻辑学家]]，写了许多这些方面的著作，<!-- One such text on [[logic|logic]] was particularly popular; its full title was, ''Logick: or The Right Use of Reason in the Enquiry After Truth With a Variety of Rules to Guard Against Error in the Affairs of Religion and Human Life, as well as in the Sciences''. This book , the ''Logick'', was first published in 1724, and its popularity and sales success ensured that it went through twenty editions. The ''Logick'' was a textbook which followed the Aristotelian and scholastic traditions in logic, (for which, see the [[Organon|Organon]], the logical works of Aristotle collected and edited by Porphyry), although the influence of Locke's ''[[Essay_Concerning_Human_Understanding|Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' is also evident in the work. Isaac Watts' ''Logick'' became the standard text on logic at Oxford, Cambridge, [[Harvard_University|Harvard]] and [[Yale_University|Yale]]; being used at Oxford for well over 100 years. Isaac Watts' writing style, his thorough acquaintance with logic as it was conceived during his time, and his personal conception of the subject, mean that the text has historical value, and remains of interest to the student of Aristotelian logic.

The ''Logick'' was followed in 1741 by a supplement, ''The Improvement of the Mind'', which itself went through numerous editions and later inspired [[Michael_Faraday|Michael Faraday]]. -->

== 纪念 ==

<!-- The earliest surviving built memorial to Isaac Watts is at [[Westminster_Abbey|Westminster Abbey]]; this was completed shortly after his death. His much-visited chest tomb, in its photogenic setting at [[Bunhill_Fields|Bunhill Fields]], dates from 1808, replacing the original that had been paid for and erected by [[Lady_Mary_Abney|Lady Mary Abney]] and the Hartopp family. In addition a stone bust of Watts can be seen in the non-conformist library [[Dr_Williams's_Library|Dr Williams's Library]] in central [[London|London]]. The earliest public statue stands at Abney Park, where he lived and died before it became a cemetery and arboretum; a later, rather similar statue, was funded by public subscription for a new Victorian public park in the city of his birth, Southampton. In the mid nineteenth century a Congregational Hall, the Dr Watts Memorial Hall, was also built in Southampton, though after the [[Second_World_War|Second World War]] it was lost to redevelopment. Now standing on this site is the Isaac Watts Memorial United Reformed Church. 

One of the earliest built memorials may also now be lost: a bust to Watts that was commissioned on his death for the London chapel with which he was associated. The chapel was demolished in the late eighteenth century; remaining parts of the memorial were rescued at the last minute by a wealthy landowner for installation in his chapel near [[利物浦|利物浦]]. It is unclear whether it still survives. -->

<!-- The stone statue in front of the [[Abney_Park_Chapel|Abney Park Chapel]] at Dr Watts' Walk, Abney Park Cemetery, was erected in 1845 by public subscription. It was designed by the leading British [[Sculpture|sculptor]], [[Edward_Hodges_Baily|Edward Hodges Baily]] [[Royal_Academy|RA]] [[FRS|FRS]]. A scheme for a commemorative statue on this spot had first been promoted in the late 1830s by [[George_Collison|George Collison]], who in 1840 published an engraving as the frontispiece of his book about cemetery design in Europe and America; and at [[Abney_Park_Cemetery|Abney Park Cemetery]] in particular. This first cenotaph proposal was never commissioned, and Baily's later design was adopted in 1845. -->

以撒華滋 (Isaac Watts) 的童年是生長在[[英國國教|英國國教]]對改革者的壓迫下，父親在英國的[[南安普敦|南安普敦]]作布商，受過高等教育，在詩歌和藝術上像他的父親多馬‧華滋 (Thomas Watts) 一樣有造詣。父親是一位不隨英國國教者，曾在參加聚會時被政府逮捕入獄，出獄後，有兩年時間獨自匿居在[[倫敦|倫敦]]。母親莎拉‧陶頓 (Sarah Taunton) 是法國人，因逃避法國天主教對新教徒的[[聖巴托羅繆之夜|聖巴多羅買大屠殺]] (Massacre of St.Bartholomew)，隨父親來到英國。以撒華滋為長子(其後有七個弟妹)，四歲時父親就教他[[拉丁文|拉丁文]]，母親帶領他讀[[聖經|聖經]]，對聖經的了解有穩固的基礎。幼時便對閱讀發生興趣，當母親給他零用錢時，會追在母親身後喊著：「給我買一本書，一本書，一本書」。他語言上的天份，再加上對當時宗教壓迫下的深刻印象，影響了他日後對聖詩的創作。

以撒華滋在十歲左右便能出口成詩，他從品漢牧師學習[[拉丁文|拉丁文]]、[[希臘文|希臘文]]、[[希伯來文|希伯來文]]和[[法文|法文]]約有十年，老師看出他的潛能，認為前途無可限量。在十五歲時他接受了[[基督|基督]]，同時有主的呼召，要他全時間事奉神。一位南安普敦的史畢德醫生，願意資助他到[[牛津大學|牛津大學]]深造，以切斷與獨立教會的關係為條件，遭到以撒華滋的拒絕。當時要就讀牛津或[[劍橋大學|劍橋大學]]必須認同英國國教，畢業後要為英國國教服務，以撒華滋在十六歲時離開家，到倫敦附近一間由獨立教會成立的紐溫頓學院 (The Academy of Newington Green) 受教育。由於徹夜不眠的閱讀，以撒華滋患了多年的失眠症，四年後，他回到南安普敦家裏有兩年半的時間。

在南安普敦，他隨著父親在公理會作禮拜，當時教會崇拜僅僅吟誦押韻的詩篇，未能反映基督的榮美，遂問他在詩歌讚美中有否新的方式？在默想中，他以聖經的[[詩篇|詩篇]]，譜寫成新約時代的聖詩。詩歌的創作早在一六九一年，十七歲時即開始，一七Ｏ二年在教堂吟唱他第一部《聖詩》(Sacred Lyrics)時，尚未付印出版。《聖詩集》(Hymns and Spiritual Songs)是在牧養教會期間創作的。英國國教對以撒華滋吟唱聖詩的方式給與饞謗，說他割裂經文，把經文轉變成詩的體材，直到一七三四年聖公會的高層人士，讚揚他對所有宗派的供獻。

以撒華滋先是在哈托普爵士 (Sir John Hartopp) 家裏擔任家庭教師；之後在哈托普夫婦聚會的馬可巷教堂擔任助理牧師，他的講道有內涵能打動人心，唯一令會眾不滿的，是他講道完便消失無蹤，會友不知他是體弱多病，常多日困於病榻。待身體恢復健康後接任牧師職位，他住進豪力斯弟兄提供的小房間，在此有了密室生活，當他的健康不允許主領聚會時，就送出一封信件，其中信息正回應一些信徒的屬靈問題。

同樣文學造詣很高的伊利沙白‧辛嘉(Elizabeth Singer)小姐，讀了以撒華滋的詩就想會晤他，及至見面卻因以撒華滋面帶病容的外貌怯步，以撒華滋向伊利沙白求婚，遭她拒絕道：「我只能這樣說，我羨慕寶石，但我也同樣羨慕裝上寶石的盒子」。
以撒華滋失望的情緒，在他第二部詩集《愛上危險的寵物》可體會出：

  　　　　　　　　地上萬物何等虛空！
  　　　　　　　　多麼虛假，而又多麼赤裸裸！
  　　　　　　　　每個歡樂都含有毒素，
  　　　　　　　　每顆糖果是一個網羅

以撒華滋終身未娶，伊利沙白‧辛嘉則成為羅德夫人(Elizabeth Rowe)，彼此以信件取得心靈的共鳴，越發讚賞以撒華滋的羅德夫人，不再羨慕裝著寶石的盒子。

以撒華滋的詩歌被人應用的例子眾多，列舉一二；[[司布真|司布真]](Charles Haddon Spurgeon)的祖父母都非常喜愛以撒華滋的詩歌，祖母零錢鼓勵年輕的司布真背誦，之後司布真在每次講道時都可找到配合的詩歌。《哎呦！救主真曾流血！》(Alas！and My Saviour bleed？)這首詩歌曾感動美國盲眼女詩人芬妮‧克羅斯比(Fanny Jane Crosby)在聚會中得著[[重生_(基督教)|重生]]的平安。一八六一年在[[印度洋|印度洋]]海島上食人的通加族(Tonga)，經過[[宣教士|宣教士]]四十年的耕耘後，由國王率五千人民以一首《耶穌必為普世君王》(Jesus shall reign)，舉行奉教禮。[[中國|中國]]的[[倪柝聲|倪柝聲]]弟兄翻譯了幾首以撒華滋的詩歌，編寫於《小羊詩歌》中。

他在一七二○年為兒童出版了《兒童聖詩集》；在一七二一年出版了《讀和寫英文的藝術》被人推薦給學校採用；在一七二四年出版《邏輯學》，此書成為牛津大學和劍橋大學的標準教科書；一七二六年著《天文與地理常識簡易課程》也成了教科書。一七二八年著《兒童禱告文》；一七三Ｏ年寫的《聖經問答題》曾多次再版；其它尚有《本體論簡明課程》、《神學中的正確答案》、《思維的善用──第一部份》等作品，使他獲得英國[[愛丁堡大學|愛丁堡大學]](University of Edinburgh)和阿伯丁大學(University of Aberdeen)頒贈神學博士學位。
