==成員和承認年分==


The Soviet membership was taken over by Russia in early 1992, following the dissolvement of the Soviet Union in December 1991. For two months, the former Soviet Union national bandy team appeared as [[獨立國家聯合體|Commonwealth of Independent States]], but the CIS was never formally a member of the FIB.

{{flagicon|Soviet Union}} '''Soviet Union 1955–1991''': When the international federation was founded in 1955, the [[苏联|Soviet Union]] was one of its founding members. The Soviet national federation was called the [[Federation_of_bandy_and_field_hockey_USSR|Federation of bandy and field hockey USSR]] (Федерация хоккея с мячом и хоккея на траве СССР). The Soviet Union had a [[Soviet_Union_national_bandy_team|national bandy team for men]] and a [[Soviet_Union_women's_national_bandy_team|national bandy team for women]]. When the Soviet Union was dissolved in December 1991, the national team came to represent the [[獨立國家聯合體|Commonwealth of Independent States]] for some months. In 1992, Russia took over its place in FIB.

{{flagicon|Germany}} '''West Germany/Germany 1990–1991''': Before the present German Bandy Association was founded in 2013, there had been an earlier, short-lived German federation, which was a member of FIB from January 1990 until March 1991, when it voluntarily choose to leave.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://bandy-bund.de/index.php?page=information|title= Information|language= de|publisher= Deutscher Bandy-Bund|date= 2013|accessdate= 9 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbandy.com/template1.asp?pageID=6 |title=FIB History |publisher=Federation of International Bandy |date=2011-09-27 |accessdate=9 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221225714/http://www.worldbandy.com/template1.asp?pageID=6 |archivedate=21 February 2014 |df= }}</ref> In its short life span, it still overlived the [[兩德統一|German reunification]] in October 1990.

A number of national federations have been admitted as members during the years<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20131016213857/http://www.worldbandy.com/members.asp?pageID=11 List of all members as of January 2012 with contact information], saved at web.archive.org, read 12 February 2017</ref> but then for different reasons not survived, often because of a lack of interest in the sport in their countries. In early 2017, these federations were removed from the member list of FIB.<ref>[http://www.worldbandy.com/members.html Members] {{Wayback|url=http://www.worldbandy.com/members.html |date=20170127123051 }} at FIB website, read on 12 February 2017</ref> These defunct national federations were:
