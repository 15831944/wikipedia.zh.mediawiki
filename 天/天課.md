'''天課'''一詞是屬於[[伊斯蘭教|伊斯蘭教]]的宗教術語，阿拉伯语“扎卡特”（Zakat）的意译，含“洁净”、“纯净”之意，也就是说通过交付“天课”使自己的财产更加洁净，这是穆斯林的重要功课之一。<ref name=qwe />在产权范畴里，可转化为“穷人的份额”或“慈善施舍”的意思。因为，据相关教法规定，当穆斯林个人资产超过了一定限额，就应按一定的比率缴纳课税，用于施舍贫困者，唯其如此，其所占有的资财才算是合法纯洁的。<ref>{{cite journal|author=马丽蓉|title=清真寺的慈善功能与伊斯兰教的“关爱弱势”思想|url=http://mideast.shisu.edu.cn/picture/article/33/e9/2f/ae90e4514a59ad4fb962b17d12c9/cb2972b6-faf9-441b-9547-7f03b44c322e.pdf}}{{Dead link|date=2019年4月 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> “天课”制度是在伊历2年(公元623年)规定的。<ref name=qwe>{{cite journal|author=曹久金|title=伊斯兰教的天课制度|journal=《阿拉伯世界研究》|year=1990|issue=04期|url=http://www.cnki.com.cn/Article/CJFDTotal-ALBJ199004006.htm}}</ref>「天課」是伊斯蘭信仰的第四基柱。穆斯林认为天课是真主安拉對那些豐衣足食的穆民的主命（fard），指令他（她）們把其每年盈餘財富的一部份用作幫助貧民和有需要的人。<ref name=a1>{{cite web|title=天課|url=http://www.islam.org.hk/6885/zakat.htm}}</ref>安拉说：“你们应当谨守拜功，完纳天课，并以善债借给真主。你们为自己做什么善事，都将在真主那里得到更好更大的报酬。你们应当向真主求饶，真主是至赦的，是至慈的。”（《古兰经》73：20）<ref>{{cite journal|author=贾喜平|title=天课的意义|journal=《中国穆斯林》|year=2002|issue=5|url=http://www.cqvip.com/qk/80455x/200205/11178513.html}}</ref>安拉说：“正义是信真主、信末日、信天神、信天经、信先知，并将所爱的财产施济亲戚、孤儿、贫民、旅客、乞丐和赎取奴隶，并谨守拜功、完纳天课、履行约言、忍受贫困、患难和战争。这等人，确是忠贞的；这等人，确是敬畏的。”（《古兰经》2:177）<ref>{{cite journal|author=马哲贤|title=伊斯兰“五功”浅释|journal=《中国穆斯林》|year=1983|issue=02期|url=http://www.cnki.com.cn/Article/CJFDTotal-ZGMS198302005.htm}}</ref>

== 作用 ==
伊斯兰教经典中，“认主独一”和“劝善戒恶”是使用比较频繁的两个词汇，体现了慈善在伊斯兰教中的地位，无论从宗教还是世俗的不同视角来看，伊斯兰教宗教慈善具有浓厚的宗教色彩、道德烙印。从宗教和社会的不同角度来看，伊斯兰教宗教慈善分为两个不同的方面：宗教功课（天课）慈善，是必须履行的义务与责任，是宗教规定必须完成的宗教功修，不可推卸；伦理道德慈善（行善、施舍），是伊斯兰教社会伦理道德的体现，强调个人对社会责任的承担，没有强制性。

天课作为一种伊斯兰教特有的宗教赋税，起着调节社会财富流向、二次分配社会财富的功能，是伊斯兰教“敬主爱人”天条使命的集中体现，具有和礼拜等同的宗教功修作用，体现出伊斯兰精神并符合伊斯兰教公正、公平、正义、平等的社会伦理原则。伊斯兰教宗教慈善事业在积极调整人与人之间的经济利益关系方面，唤起了穆斯林的宗教热情和社会责任，对阿拉伯半岛伦理道德和社会责任的重塑起到关键作用。伊斯兰教宗教慈善经过千百年积淀和嬗变，已逐渐渗透到穆斯林社会生活各个领域和层面，成为一种生活方式、文化形态，影响着广大穆斯林民众。清晰伊斯兰教宗教慈善事业，有助于人们全面、客观、历史的认识伊斯兰文化。<ref>{{cite journal|author=王许林|title=试论伊斯兰教早期的慈善事业|journal=《东北师范大学》|year=2011|url=http://cdmd.cnki.com.cn/Article/CDMD-10200-1012292427.htm}}</ref>

「天課」一詞對於伊斯蘭教來說屬於[[五功|五善功]]之一，亦可簡稱為「課」，意指「法定施捨」。

天课的接受对象在《古兰经》中有如下规定：「救濟品惟歸給窮困的、赤貧的、為此工作的、其心可得安定的、用以贖身的、拖欠外債的、用於安拉之道上、與旅客。這是安拉的規定，安拉是深知的、明哲的。」（古蘭經第九章六十節）<ref name=a1/>

'''Zakāt''' ({{lang-ar|زكاة}}) is the [[Islam|Islam]]ic concept of [[Tithe|tithing]] and [[alms|alms]]. 

==Etymology==
'''Zakāt''' – [[classical_Arabic|classical Arabic]]: زكوة; [[Arabic_language|modern Arabic]]: زكاة; [[Turkish_language|Turkish]]: ''Zekât''; also [[Arabic_transliteration|transliterated]] '''''zakaat''''' or '''''zakah'''''; "to grow" (in goodness), "increase," "purifying," "foster," "making pure".

==Overview==
It is the third of the [[Five_Pillars_of_Islam|Five Pillars of Islam]] and refers to spending a fixed portion of one's wealth for the [[Poverty|poor]] or [[need|need]]y, including people whose hearts need to be reconciled, [[Slavery|slaves]], those in "debt," those in the way of [[Allah|God]], and the travelers in the society.

The basis of zakat is given in the [[Qur'an|Qur'an]]: "Of their goods take alms, that so thou mightest purify and sanctify them; and pray on their behalf, verily thy prayers are a source of security for them." (9:103)

A [[Muslim|Muslim]] may also donate an additional amount as an act of voluntary charity ([[sadaqah|sadaqah]]), in order to achieve additional divine reward.

There are two main types of zakât:

*'''Zakât on traffic
'' (''[[zakât-ul-fitr|zakât-ul-fitr]]'') is a per head payment equivalent to cost of around 2.25 kilograms of the main food of the region (this may be wheat, dates or rice, depending on the place) paid during the month of [[Ramadan|Ramadan]] by the head of a family for him/herself and his/her dependents to the zakât collector (amil).(Right now in the U.S. the zakat on traffic is $7.50)

*'''Zakât on wealth''' (''[[zakât-ul-mal|zakât-ul-mal]]'') comprises all other types of zakât, such as on business, on savings, on income, on crops, on livestock, on gold, on minerals, on hidden treasures unearthed, etc. 

The payment of zakât is obligatory on all Muslims. In current usage it is interpreted as a 2.5% levy on most valuables and savings held for a full [[lunar|lunar]] year, if the total value is more than a basic minimum known as [[nisab|nisab]] (3 [[ounce|ounce]]s or 87.48g of gold). At present (as of 5 October 2006), nisab is approximately US $1,725 or an equivalent amount in any other currency [http://www.ramadhanzone.com/zakat_calculator.asp]. 

Zakât is distributed among 8 categories of people:

* ''[[Faqir|Faqir]]'' - One who has neither material possessions nor means of livelihood.
* ''[[Miskin|Miskin]]'' - One with insufficient means of livelihood to meet basic needs.
* ''[[Amil_(Islamic_term)|Amil]]'' - Workers associated with the collection and distribution of Zakat.
* ''[[Muallafathul_Quloob|Muallafathul Quloob]]'' - One who converts to Islam. Literally those whose hearts are softened. 
* ''[[Riqab|Riqab]]'' - One who wants to free himself from bondage or the shackles of slavery.
* ''[[Gharmin|Gharmin]]'' - One who is in debt (money borrowed to meet basic, [[halal|halal]] expenditure).
* ''[[Fisabilillah|Fisabilillah]]'' - Literal meaning 'In the way of God', but it is used for [[Jihad|Jihad]].
* ''[[Ibnus_Sabil|Ibnus Sabil]]'' - One who is stranded in journey.

==Restrictions==
There have been cases where you don't/can't pay zakat for/to.
*Traditional zakat laws generally does not cover trade
*It is not permissible to pay zakat to some members of the family (i.e. grandparents, parents, spouses, children)
*If a [[Muslim|Muslim]] doesn't have enough money to pay zakat

It should be noted that zakat should be paid so in the following year, the zakat money should not been given to that same person.

==Shiite Interpretation of Zakat==
According to the Shiite interpretation, also based on the Quran and reported speeches of the prophet Muhammad and his Household, there are two major forms of almsgiving: Khoms ("the fifth"), and Zakat. The Shiite consider both types to be a personal obligation, meaning that every Muslim has the full responsibility of purifying his own money, but the governor should have no force upon any individual to give up Zakat or Khoms. Khoms ("the fifth") is taken from war loots, metals, treasures, divings (pearls and so), and the money that is a mix between halal (pure) and haram (taboo). In modern days, the most common type of khoms that is extracted is of the last type mentioned before. Khoms for money is done by taking the fifth of the increment or the increase in the income stored after one lunar year, and this is done after paying debts or bills (if any).

An example calculation of the Khoms tithe: A man starts with $5000 in his bank account; on the same day after one lunar year passes, he has $5600 in his bank account (having already paid his bills and debts), and so must take the fifth of his $600 earnings, that is $120. What remains after the fifth (that is 5600-120=$5480) is recorded; if after one lunar year the man has more than $5480, then he finds the new difference and extracts a fifth from it as before. If instead he has less than $5480, then he has no earnings on which to pay Khoms. The Khoms is paid specifically for any Hashimite person, meaning a person that has his roots extend to the tribe of Bani Hashim (the tribe of prophet Muhammad) or a descendant of prophet Muhammad in general.

Zakat on the other hand, according to the Shiite teachings, is assigned to specific goods. There are nine types of goods from which Zakat is paid out: gold, silver, camels, cows, sheep, wheat, barley, dates, and raisins. Each type has its own "nisab," or a limit under which Zakat need not be paid. Zakat is paid to the people mentioned in the overview of this article, although never to a Hashimite. Charity money or Sadaqah is never to be paid to a Hashimite since it is a taboo for a Hashimite to take such money, if it is not Khoms or a gift. Notice that in both concepts, they are obligatory on the individual but should not be forced by the governor.

In modern days, Shiite muslims are concerned with Khoms more than Zakat mainly because few of them are farmers and own the goods by which Zakat is paid out. On the other hand, Khoms is given by many people starting from the middle class and above that, and especially by employees.
