==分集==

===第一集：永恒的边境（[[北美|北美]][[加拿大|加拿大]]，1万1千年前）===
It starts with animals living during the [[Ice_Age|Ice Age]]. It also shows how humans became top predators and started hunting mammoths on the continent with deadly spears. We also had to compete with other predators like the Short-faced Bear and the Saber-toothed cats. We destroyed them by depleting their food supply, and making them starve to death. Later after realizing what they done to the great beast's demise they hunted not all the time and then there were no more extinctions in the Americas. That wasn't until pioneers from Europe like [[克里斯托弗·哥伦布|克里斯托弗·哥伦布]], several [[征服者|征服者]] and lots of horses were brought by the Conquistadors arrived in North America. Howevever horses are returning to the land of which they evolved in. Also inventing the [[gun|gun]], which in North America, was used primarily for hunting big game animals like the bison. By 1893 only 500 wild buffalo remained, marking the end of the megafauna in the Americas.

===第二集：燃烧（[[澳洲|澳洲]]，6万5千年前）===
本集展示的是{{le|澳洲史前史|Prehistory of Australia|人类是怎样进入澳洲}}。 We also hunted the native wildlife. We encountered the huge birds and the giant lizard, megalania. The reptiles kill two humans and they plan on burning the fields and vined forests to kill the giant lizard and other beasts to extinction. We then start to colonize other lands in the New World. While after burning the forests
most of the animal species survived the forest fires, also this changed the habitat of Australia as it is today. Marsupials, small lizards, birds and other animals are doing well than their counterparts who all died in the fire.

===第三集：告别伊甸园（[[新西兰|新西兰]]，约公元1280年）===
It starts with humans populating [[New_Zealand|New Zealand]]. We encounter the giant moa. We start to see it was harmless. We then discover Haast's eagle, which hunts moas and starts to target us. We then start to steal the moa's giant eggs and go after the adults for food. We then realize we brought a huge amount of animals to extinction. The program has a part with footage of most of the animals shown in the series and starts to ask the question that if we can't live with these monsters, are we not monsters ourselves. The program then ends on ''[[復活節島|復活節島]]'' about the aftermath of New Zealand's old world with the giant birds gone and forests as so did the early settlers of New Zealand.
