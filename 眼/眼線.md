Eye liner is commonly used in a daily make-up routine to define the eye or create the look of a wider or smaller eye. Eye liner can be used as a tool to create various looks as well as highlighting different features of the eyes.  Eye liner can be placed in various parts of the eye to create different looks with a winged eye liner or {{tsl|en|||tight lined}} at the waterline. Eye liner can be drawn above upper lashes or below lower lashes or both, even on the water lines of your eyes. Its primary purpose is to make the lashes look lush, but it also draws attention to the eye and can enhance or even change the eye's shape. Eye liner is available in a wide range of hues, from the common black, brown and grey to more adventurous shades such as bright primary colors, pastels, frosty silvers and golds, white and even glitter-flecked colors.

Eye liner can also be used for showing depression in photographs, such as the {{clarify|text=famous "Bleeding Mascara"|What does this refer to?|date=June 2015}}.<ref>{{cite web|last=Thompson |first=Tina |title=Bleeding Mascara: Eyeliner for Depressionistas |url=http://eyelinertips.net/bleeding-mascara/ |accessdate=7 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220090501/http://eyelinertips.net/bleeding-mascara/ |archivedate=February 20, 2012 }}</ref>

===Different modern uses===
Although many users of eye liner use it on a day-to-day basis for a simple definer of the eyes, there are others who use it for more than just an easy eye enlarger. There are many styles of eye liner. Most of them usually revolve around the winged eye liner, which is defining around your top eyelid shape and a line, about halfway toward the end of the eyebrow. It is usually connected to the defining around the top. However today there are some drastically toned eye liner.

===Tight lining===
Tight lining is the use of eye liner tight against the [[瞼板腺|瞼板腺]] under the lashes of the upper lid, and above the lashes of the lower lid. Due to the proximity to the membranes, and the surface of the eye itself, waterproof eye liner is preferred. Tight lining is a technique which makes the eyelashes appear to start farther back on the eyelid, thus making them look longer. Gel eye liner and a small angled brush may be used to create this look.<ref>{{cite news|title=Tightlining: How-To|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/12/tightlining-eyeliner-makeup-tips_n_2853595.html | work=Huffington Post | first=Simone|last=Kitchens|date=12 March 2013}}</ref>

==Types==

Depending on its texture, eye liner can be softly smudged or clearly defined. There are five main types of eye liner available on the market: each produces a different effect.

*''Liquid eye liner'' is an opaque liquid that usually comes in a small bottle and is typically applied with a small sharp-tipped brush. It creates a clean, precise line. Because liquid eye liner gives a much heavier appearance, it is often only applied to the upper lash-line.
*''Powder-based eye pencil'' is eye liner in a wood pencil.  It is generally available in dark, matted shades.
*''Wax-based eye pencils'' are softer pencils and contain waxes that ease application. They come in a wide variety of intense colours as well as paler shades such as white or beige. Wax-based eye liners can also come in a cone or a compact with brush applicator.
*''[[眼影粉|眼影粉]]'' eye liner is a soft powder available in dark matte shades.  It is most often used in black to outline the eyes.  It comes in pencil, pressed powder, or loose powder form.  This type of eye liner is more likely to smudge.
* ''Gel eye liner'', which is a softer gel liner, that can be easily applied with an eye liner brush.  It can be precisely applied and is much softer than Kohl.

==Chemical composition==
