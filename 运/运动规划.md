'''运动规划'''（{{lang-en|Motion Planning}}）是一个过程，用来寻找从起始状态到目标状态的移动步骤。运动规划常常需要在运动受到约束的条件下找到最优解。运动规划多用于[[机器人学|机器人学]]。

例如，一个清洁机器人在楼层里打扫卫生，它不能撞墙，也不能从楼梯口掉下去。给定一个任务，运动规划算法计算出一个动作序列，告诉机器人前进多少米，然后左转右转多少度。如果机器人要操作物品或者探测未知地形等等，运动规划就变得很复杂了。

除了机器人学，运动规划在[[计算机游戏|计算机游戏]]里也用来模拟人物或车辆的运动。

基本的运动规划问题是通过连续的动作从'''起始位形'''s到达'''目标位形'''g，并且过程中要避开障碍物。机器人和障碍物可以抽象为二维或三维的几何图形，动作则被表示为[[位形空间|位形空间]]中的路径。

===自由空间===
[[Image:Motion_planning_workspace_1_configuration_space_1.svg|thumb]]
如果机器人采用某个位形时不会碰到障碍物，那么这个位形属于自由位形空间，简称自由空间（英文写作<math>C_{free}</math>）。自由空间的[[补集|补集]]即障碍空间。

测试一个位形是否属于自由空间是简单的。先用正向运动学确定机器人的轮廓，然后查看机器人是否与障碍物碰撞。

==算法==
低维度的运动规划问题可以用基于格点的算法求解，如[[A*算法|A*算法]]。

Low-dimensional problems can be solved with grid-based algorithms that overlay a grid on top of configuration space, or geometric algorithms that compute the shape and connectivity of C<sub>free</sub>.

Exact motion planning for high-dimensional systems under complex constraints is computationally [[Computational_complexity_theory|intractable]].  Potential-field algorithms are efficient, but fall prey to local minima (an exception is the harmonic potential fields).  Sampling-based algorithms avoid the problem of local minima, and solve many problems quite quickly.
They are unable to determine that no path exists, but they have a probability of failure that decreases to zero as more time is spent.

Sampling-based algorithms are currently considered state-of-the-art for motion planning in high-dimensional spaces, and have been applied to problems which have dozens or even hundreds of dimensions (robotic manipulators, biological molecules, animated digital characters, and legged robots).

===Grid-Based Search===
Grid-based approaches overlay a grid on configuration space, and assume each configuration is identified with a grid point.  At each grid point, the robot is allowed to move to adjacent grid points as long as the line between them is completely contained within C<sub>free</sub> (this is tested with collision detection).  This discretizes the set of actions, and [[search_algorithms|search algorithms]] (like [[A*_search_algorithm|A*]]) are used to find a path from the start to the goal.

These approaches require setting a grid resolution.  Search is faster with coarser grids, but the algorithm will fail to find paths through narrow portions of C<sub>free</sub>.  Furthermore, the number of points on the grid grows exponentially in the configuration space dimension, which make them inappropriate for high-dimensional problems.

Traditional grid-based approaches produce paths whose heading changes are constrained to multiples of a given base angle, often resulting in suboptimal paths. [[Any-angle_path_planning|Any-angle path planning]] approaches find shorter paths by propagating information along grid edges (to search fast) without constraining their paths to grid edges (to find short paths).

Grid-based approaches often need to search repeatedly, for example, when the knowledge of the robot about the configuration space changes or the configuration space itself changes during path following. [[Incremental_heuristic_search|Incremental heuristic search]] algorithms replan fast by using experience with the previous similar path-planning problems to speed up their search for the current one.

===Interval-Based Search===
These approaches are similar to grid-based search approaches except 
that they generate a paving covering entirely the configuration space instead of a grid

.
The paving is decomposed into two [[subpaving|subpaving]]s X<sup>-</sup>,X<sup>+</sup> made with boxes
such that
X<sup>-</sup> ⊂ C<sub>free</sub> ⊂ X<sup>+</sup>.
Characterizing C<sub>free</sub> amounts to solve a [[set_inversion|set inversion problem]]. 
[[Interval_arithmetic|Interval analysis]] could 
thus be used when C<sub>free</sub> cannot be described by linear inequalities in order to have a guaranteed 
enclosure.
   
The robot is thus allowed to move freely in X<sup>-</sup>, and cannot go outside X<sup>+</sup>.
To both subpavings, a neighbor graph is built and paths can be found using
algorithms such as [[Dijkstra's_algorithm|Dijkstra]] or [[A*_search_algorithm|A*]].  
When a path is feasible in X<sup>-</sup>, it is also feasible
in C<sub>free</sub>. When no path exists in X<sup>+</sup> from one initial configuration to the goal, 
we have the guarantee that no feasible path exists in C<sub>free</sub>.
As for the grid-based approach, the interval approach is inappropriate 
for high-dimensional problems, due to the fact that the number of boxes to be generated 
grows exponentially with respect to the dimension of configuration space.

An illustration is provided by the three figures on the right where
a hook with two degrees of freedom has to move from the left to the right, avoiding two horizontal small segments.  
[[File:Graph2displaycolor.jpg|thumb|
Motion from the initial configuration (blue) to the final configuration of the hook, avoiding the two obstacles (red segments). The left-bottom corner of the hook has to stay on the horizontal line, 
which makes the hook two degrees of freedom.

[[File:Graph1sivia.jpg|thumb|

and the subpaving X<sup>+</sup> is the union of red and green boxes. The path corresponds to the motion
represented above.
]]
[[File:Graph3cameleon.jpg|thumb|
This figure corresponds to the same path as above but obtained with many fewer boxes.
The algorithm avoids bisecting boxes in parts of the configuration space 
that do not influence the final result.
]]
The decomposition with subpavings using interval analysis also makes it possible to characterize
the topology of C<sub>free</sub> such as counting its number of connected components

===Potential Fields===
One approach is to treat the robot's configuration as a point in a potential field that combines attraction to the goal, and repulsion from obstacles.  The resulting trajectory is output as the path.  This approach has advantages in that the trajectory is produced with little computation.  However, they can become trapped in [[local_minima|local minima]] of the potential field, and fail to find a path.

===Sampling-Based Algorithms===
Sampling-based algorithms represent the configuration space with a roadmap of sampled configurations.
A basic algorithm samples N configurations in C, and retains those in C<sub>free</sub> to use as ''milestones''.  A roadmap is then constructed that connects two milestones P and Q if the line segment PQ is completely in C<sub>free</sub>.  Again, collision detection is used to test inclusion in C<sub>free</sub>.  To find a path that connects S and G, they are added to the roadmap.  If a path in the roadmap links S and G, the planner succeeds, and returns that path.  If not, the reason is not definitive: either there is no path in C<sub>free</sub>, or the planner did not sample enough milestones.

These algorithms work well for high-dimensional configuration spaces, because unlike combinatorial algorithms, their running time is not (explicitly) exponentially dependent on the dimension of C.  They are also (generally) substantially easier to implement.  They are probabilistically complete, meaning the probability that they will produce a solution approaches 1 as more time is spent.  However, they cannot determine if no solution exists.

Given basic ''visibility'' conditions on C<sub>free</sub>, it has been proven that as the number of configurations N grows higher, the probability that the above algorithm finds a solution approaches 1 exponentially.<ref>{{Cite journal

}}</ref>  Visibility is not explicitly dependent on the dimension of C; it is possible to have a high-dimensional space with "good" visibility or a low-dimensional space with "poor" visibility.  The experimental success of sample-based methods suggests that most commonly seen spaces have good visibility.

There are many variants of this basic scheme:
* It is typically much faster to only test segments between nearby pairs of milestones, rather than all pairs.
* Nonuniform sampling distributions attempt to place more milestones in areas that improve the connectivity of the roadmap.
* [[Quasirandom|Quasirandom]] samples typically produce a better covering of configuration space than [[pseudorandom|pseudorandom]] ones, though some recent work argues that the effect of the source of randomness is minimal compared to the effect of the sampling distribution.
* It is possible to substantially reduce the number of milestones needed to solve a given problem by allowing curved eye sights (for example by crawling on the obstacles that block the way between two milestones <ref>{{Cite journal

* If only one or a few planning queries are needed, it is not always necessary to construct a roadmap of the entire space.  Tree-growing variants are typically faster for this case (single-query planning).  Roadmaps are still useful if many queries are to be made on the same space (multi-query planning)

==Completeness and Performance==
A motion planner is said to be complete if the planner in finite time either produces a solution or correctly reports that there is none. Most complete algorithms are geometry-based. The performance of a complete planner is assessed by its [[Computational_complexity_theory|computational complexity]].

''Resolution completeness'' is the property that the planner is guaranteed to find a path if the resolution of an underlying grid is fine enough.  Most resolution complete planners are grid-based or interval-based.  The computational complexity of resolution complete planners is dependent on the number of points in the underlying grid, which is O(1/h<sup>d</sup>), where h is the resolution (the length of one side of a grid cell) and d is the configuration space dimension.

''Probabilistic completeness'' is the property that as more “work” is performed, the probability that the planner fails to find a path, if one exists, asymptotically approaches zero.  Several sample-based methods are probabilistically complete.  The performance of a probabilistically complete planner is measured by the rate of convergence.

''Incomplete'' planners do not always produce a feasible path when one exists.  Sometimes incomplete planners do work well in practice.
