'''籃球服'''是[[籃球|籃球]]球員所穿的[[制服|制服]]。 籃球服背面有球員的號碼和姓氏(或名字)，通常還會搭配[[短褲|短褲]]和[[運動鞋|運動鞋]]。在隊伍中,球員會穿上代表球隊顏色的球衣。主場隊伍通常會穿淺色的球衣，客場隊伍通常會穿深色的球衣。

不同的籃球聯賽對於場上的球衣有不同的規範。在籃球早期發展階段中，球員可以穿著任何類型的運動服。但在20世紀初期，特殊的運動服已經被製造出來並販售給籃球員。球衣的風格、剪裁還有合身程度在後來的幾十年中不斷改進，而改進的方向大抵以當時的流行為主。

最早，籃球服裝並沒有被規範，而是有各式各樣的種類，從田徑服到美式足球服都有人穿著。The first official basketball uniforms, as displayed in the [[Spalding_(sports_equipment)|Spalding]] catalog of 1901, featured three types of pants: knee-length padded pants, similar to those worn for playing football, as well as shorter pants and knee-length tights. There were two types of suggested jersey, a quarter-length sleeve and a sleeveless version.<ref name="Naismith1941">{{cite book|author=James Naismith|title=Basketball: Its Origin and Development|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yDKtaGdhZncC&pg=PA89|year=1941|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|isbn=0-8032-8370-9|pages=89-90}}</ref> 

The long pants later evolved into medium-length shorts in the 1920s, and by the 1930s, the material used for jerseys changed from heavy [[wool|wool]] to the lighter [[polyester|polyester]] and [[nylon|nylon]]. In the 1970s and 80s, uniforms became tighter-fitting and shorts were shorter, consistent with the overall fashion trends of these two decades.<ref name="Raatma2012">{{cite book|author=Lucia Raatma|title=The Curious, Captivating, Unusual History of Sports|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k6om9avhJfoC&pg=PA13|date=1 January 2012|publisher=Capstone Press|isbn=978-1-4296-7537-6|page=13}}</ref> At this time, women's basketball uniforms transitioned from longer-sleeved uniforms to [[Sleeveless_shirt|tank-top]] style jerseys similar to men's basketball uniforms, which more explicitly showed off players' muscle tone.<ref name="McCullough2007">{{cite book|author=Sarah McCullough|title=Construction of the Female Athletic Body: A Study of Women's Sport Uniforms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ojp42Q-ihI4C&pg=PA76|year=2007|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=978-0-549-26375-3|pages=76–78}}</ref>

In 1984, [[Michael_Jordan|Michael Jordan]] asked for longer shorts and helped popularize the move away from tight, short shorts toward the longer, baggier shorts worn by basketball players today.<ref name="LeBoutillier2011">{{cite book|author=Nate LeBoutillier|title=The Best of Everything Basketball Book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R9mlMwWQqJgC&pg=PA59|date=1 January 2011|publisher=Capstone|isbn=978-1-4296-5468-5|pages=58-59}}</ref><ref name="Slade2013">{{cite book|author=Suzanne Slade|title=The Technology of Basketball|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=otgFCniq8tsC&pg=PA20|date=1 January 2013|publisher=Capstone|isbn=978-1-4296-9956-3|pages=20–21}}</ref> Throughout the 1990s, basketball uniforms fell under the influence of [[hip_hop|hip hop]] culture, with shorts becoming longer and looser-fitting, team colors brighter, and designs more flashy and suggestive of rappers' [[bling|bling]].<ref name="Lane2007">{{cite book|author=Jeffrey Lane|title=Under the Boards: The Cultural Revolution in Basketball|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nqEfWSh17IwC&pg=PA74|date=1 December 2007|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|isbn=0-8032-0755-7|page=41}}</ref> At the turn of the 21st century, basketball uniforms became even more oversized and loose-fitting; the arm holes in women's basketball jerseys remained smaller than men's, but were wide enough to reveal the players' [[sports_bra|sports bra]]s.<ref name="McCullough2007">{{cite book|author=Sarah McCullough|title=Construction of the Female Athletic Body: A Study of Women's Sport Uniforms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ojp42Q-ihI4C&pg=PA76|year=2007|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=978-0-549-26375-3|pages=76–78}}</ref>

====Sleeved jersey====
For the Christmas Day games of 2013, the NBA and its apparel partner [[Adidas|Adidas]] introduced a newly designed sleeved jersey with large team and NBA logos on the front.<ref>{{cite web|last=Patt|first=Jason|title=NBA Christmas Day uniforms 2013: Teams to wear new sleeved jerseys|url=https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2013/12/25/5243450/2013-nba-christmas-jerseys|work=SBNation|accessdate=25 December 2013}}</ref> Marketers for the new uniforms realized that fans were unwilling to wear sleeveless jerseys in their day-to-day life and hoped the new sleeved jerseys would be more popular for everyday wear.<ref name=wsj>{{cite web|last=Holmes|first=Elizabeth|title=NBA Christmas Jerseys—Now With Sleeves|url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304243904579195860755097586|work=WSJ Online|accessdate=25 December 2013}}</ref> However, it was also a "not-so-well-kept secret that the NBA wanted to implement jersey ads in the years following the introduction of sleeved jerseys" as the "sleeves allow more space for potential partners to add their corporate logos to jerseys" like association football (soccer). After the league deal with Adidas expired and [[Nike,_Inc.|Nike]] signed on as the new apparel partner, the sleeved jersey did not continue.<ref>[https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2017/10/6/16203076/nba-sleeved-jerseys-nike-lebron-james]</ref>

The sleeved jersey was controversial among players.  LeBron James famously ripped the sleeves off during a prime time game against the [[New_York_Knicks|New York Knicks]] in 2015, but in the [[2016_NBA_Finals|2016 NBA Finals]] James convinced his teammates to wear the sleeved jerseys in Game 5 and again in the title-clinching Game 7.<ref>[https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2017/10/6/16203076/nba-sleeved-jerseys-nike-lebron-james]</ref><ref name="CavsAltUnis2015">{{cite news|title=Cavs Unveil Three New Alternate Uniforms for 2015-16 Season|url=http://www.nba.com/cavaliers/news/releases/jersey-announcement-151021|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=NBA.com/Cavaliers|date=October 21, 2015|accessdate=October 22, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.si.com/nba/2016/06/19/nba-finals-game-7-cavs-black-sleeved-jerseys-warriors|title=Cavs wearing sleeved jerseys in Game 7|last=|first=|date=19 June 2016|work=SI.com|access-date=2017-06-17|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cleveland.com/cavs/index.ssf/2017/06/cavaliers_wearing_black_jersey.html|title=Cavaliers wearing black jerseys for Game 2: 2017 NBA Finals|last=Vardon|first=Joe|date=4 June 2017|work=cleveland.com|access-date=2017-06-17|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name="CavaliersLogoSuite">{{cite news|title=Cavaliers Logo Suite Evolves to Modernize Look|url=http://www.nba.com/cavaliers/releases/updated-logo-170531|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=NBA.com/Cavaliers|date=May 31, 2017|accessdate=June 13, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/look-cavs-unveil-new-logos-add-black-to-color-scheme-before-start-of-nba-finals/|title=LOOK: Cavs unveil new logos, add black to color scheme before start of NBA Finals|last=Boone|first=Kyle|date=1 June 2017|work=CBSSports.com|access-date=2017-06-17|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}</ref>

=== Shoes ===

In 1903, a special basketball shoe with suction cups to prevent slippage was added to the official basketball uniform demonstrated in the Spalding catalog.<ref name="Naismith1941">{{cite book|author=James Naismith|title=Basketball: Its Origin and Development|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yDKtaGdhZncC&pg=PA89|year=1941|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|isbn=0-8032-8370-9|pages=89-90}}</ref> 
Over the decades, different shoe brands and styles were popular as basketball shoes: [[Chuck_Taylor_All-Stars|Chuck Taylor All-Stars]] and [[Keds|Keds]] in the 1960s and 70s; [[Adidas|Adidas]] and [[Nike,_Inc.|Nike]] leather [[high-tops|high-tops]] in the late 1970s and 80s; and [[Air_Jordans|Air Jordans]] in the 1990s.<ref name="LeBoutillier2011">{{cite book|author=Nate LeBoutillier|title=The Best of Everything Basketball Book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R9mlMwWQqJgC&pg=PA59|date=1 January 2011|publisher=Capstone|isbn=978-1-4296-5468-5|pages=58-59}}</ref>

=== Accessories ===

In the 1970s, [[Slick_Watts|Slick Watts]] and [[Bill_Walton|Bill Walton]] began to wear headbands, which soon became popular with other players. [[Rick_Barry|Rick Barry]] popularized wrist-bands, and other players soon created variations, such as bands that covered their forearms or biceps. These were used to wipe off sweat, or simply worn as fashion statements.<ref name="LeBoutillier2011">{{cite book|author=Nate LeBoutillier|title=The Best of Everything Basketball Book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R9mlMwWQqJgC&pg=PA59|date=1 January 2011|publisher=Capstone|isbn=978-1-4296-5468-5|pages=58-59}}</ref>

=== 美國籃球 ===

==== 規定 ====

在職業籃球或正式比賽中，主場隊伍通常會穿著比客場隊伍更淺色的球衣。<ref name="HarariOminsky2002">{{cite book|author1=P. J. Harari|author2=Dave Ominsky|title=Basketball Made Simple: A Spectator's Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gtNDH_pR990C&pg=PA10|date=1 October 2002|publisher=First Base Sports, Inc.|isbn=978-1-884309-13-7|page=10}}</ref>

在[[NBA|NBA]]中，球褲褲緣不能超過膝蓋以上一英呎處，而且球衣底下不能穿著[[T-shirts|T-shirts]]；而美國[[國家大學體育協會|大學籃球]]的規定就比較寬鬆。許多NBA與[[WNBA|WNBA]]在球衣上有著贊助商的廣告標誌。<ref name=nytWNBA>{{cite news|last=Sandomir|first=Richard|title=In W.N.B.A., Jersey Sponsorship Could Set New Standard|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/01/sports/basketball/01wnba.html?_r=0|accessdate=25 December 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=31 May 2009}}</ref>

==== 材質 ====

Uniforms are made of [[wicking|wicking]] material designed to absorb sweat and ensure that it evaporates faster.<ref name="Raatma2012">{{cite book|author=Lucia Raatma|title=The Curious, Captivating, Unusual History of Sports|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k6om9avhJfoC&pg=PA13|date=1 January 2012|publisher=Capstone Press|isbn=978-1-4296-7537-6|page=13}}</ref> They are the product of a four-year study researching professional basketball players, who identified the need for fewer seams, lighter weight, and faster drying and cooling in their jerseys.<ref name="Slade2013">{{cite book|author=Suzanne Slade|title=The Technology of Basketball|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=otgFCniq8tsC&pg=PA20|date=1 January 2013|publisher=Capstone|isbn=978-1-4296-9956-3|pages=20–21}}</ref>

=== International basketball leagues ===

The main difference between U.S. basketball uniforms and those of other countries is the appearance of sponsorship iconography; European basketball uniforms are often covered in the logos of their sponsors (similar to association football), while the U.S. uniforms (like other major pro sports) feature the team wordmark/logo front and center.<ref name=bleacherreport>{{cite web|last=O'Brien|first=Dan|title=NBA Debate: Should the NBA Put Advertisements on Jerseys?|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1124800-nba-debate-should-the-nba-put-advertisements-on-jerseys|work=The Bleacher Report|accessdate=25 December 2013}}</ref> 

For the 2017-18 season, some U.S. teams have started putting sponsorship logos on their jerseys on the upper left of the jersey which is a maximum of 2.5 inches by 2.5 inches.<ref>[https://www.sbnation.com/2017/7/26/16036162/nba-jersey-patch-sponsor-tracker-2017-season]</ref>
