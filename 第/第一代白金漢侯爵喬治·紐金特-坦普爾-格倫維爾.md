he was appointed a Teller of the [[Exchequer|Exchequer]] in [[1764|1764]], and ten years later was returned to [[Parliament_of_Great_Britain|Parliament]] as one of the Members for [[Buckinghamshire|Buckinghamshire]]. In the [[British_House_of_Commons|House of Commons]] he was a sharp critic of the American policy of [[Frederick_North,_Lord_North|Lord North]]. In September [[1779|1779]] he succeeded his uncle as 3rd '''Earl Temple'''; in [[1782|1782]] was appointed [[Lord_Lieutenant_of_Buckinghamshire|Lord Lieutenant of Buckinghamshire]]; and in July of the same year became a member of the [[Privy_Council|Privy Council]] and [[Lord_Lieutenant_of_Ireland|Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]] in the Ministry of [[William_Petty,_2nd_Earl_of_Shelburne|Lord Shelburne]]. On his advice the [[Renunciation_Act_1783|Renunciation Act 1783]] was passed, which supplemented the legislative independence granted to Ireland in [[1782|1782]]. By Royal Warrant he created the [[Order_of_St_Patrick|Order of St Patrick]] in February [[1783|1783]], with himself as the first Grand Master. Lord Temple left Ireland in 1783, and again turned his attention to English politics. He enjoyed the confidence of [[George_III_of_the_United_Kingdom|King George III]], and having opposed [[Charles_James_Fox|Fox's]] [[East_India_Bill|East India Bill]], he was authorized by the King to say that "whoever voted for the India Bill was not only not his friend, but would be considered by him as an enemy", a message which ensured the defeat of the bill. He was appointed a [[Secretary_of_State|Secretary of State]] when the younger [[William_Pitt_the_Younger|Pitt]] formed his Ministry in December 1783, but resigned two days later. In December [[1784|1784]] he was created '''Marquess of Buckingham'''.

In November [[1787|1787]] he was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Ireland under Pitt, but his second tenure of this office was hardly as successful as the first.  He was denounced by Grattan for extravagance; was censured by the Irish Houses of Parliament for refusing to transmit to England an address calling upon the [[George_IV_of_the_United_Kingdom|Prince of Wales]] to assume the regency; and he could only maintain his position by resorting to bribery on a large scale. Having become very unpopular he resigned his office in September [[1789|1789]] and subsequently took very little part in politics, although he spoke in favour of the union with Ireland. He died at his residence, [[Stowe,_Buckinghamshire|Stowe]] in [[Buckinghamshire|Buckinghamshire]], on [[11_February|11 February]] [[1813|1813]], and was buried at Wotton. In [[1775|1775]] he had married [[Mary_Nugent-Temple-Grenville,_Marchioness_of_Buckingham|Lady Mary Nugent]], daughter of [[Robert_Nugent,_1st_Earl_Nugent|Robert Nugent, 1st Earl Nugent]]. Lady Buckingham died in [[1812|1812]].
