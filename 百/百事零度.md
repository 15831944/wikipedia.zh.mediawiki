2013年6月15日，百事公司在Facebook上告知消费者：新配方的百事可乐将不再含有阿斯巴甜，这种人造甜味剂用于包括百事清怡在内的大量产品。所以，在此之后美国销售的部分百事可乐包装上写着“不含阿斯巴甜”，但是，作为甜味剂的乙酰磺胺酸钾仍然存在于百事可乐配方之中。

除美国外，百事零度还在[[加拿大|加拿大]]、[[荷兰|荷兰]]、[[芬兰|芬兰]]和[[新西兰|新西兰]]等地销售。

[[Pepsi_Edge|Pepsi Edge]], Pepsi's first mid-calorie cola, was introduced in 2004, and discontinued only two years later. PepsiCo, towards the end of the 2000s found new interest in mid-calorie beverages, and then released G2, a version of Gatorade with less than half the calories, and in the year 2011, Trop50, a juice blend, with 50% the calories of regular juice.

In September 2007, PepsiCo filed for trademarks in the [[US_Patent_and_Trademark_Office|US Patent and Trademark Office]], for "Pepsi Next", and "Diet Pepsi Next".

In 2010, PepsiCo began to test Pepsi Next via market research groups. In June 2011, PepsiCo announced that Pepsi Next was going to be moved into two test markets, [[Cedar_Rapids,_Iowa|Cedar Rapids, Iowa]], and [[Eau_Claire,_Wisconsin|Eau Claire, Wisconsin]].

==反响和口味==
One site stated that, ''Although it contains three artificial sweeteners and has 60 percent fewer calories than regular Pepsi, it’s really hard to taste anything “diet” about Pepsi Next. But it’s not quite like regular Pepsi; it’s less syrupy and smoother. There are also differences in flavor between Pepsi Next and original Pepsi. I thought Pepsi Next had a slightly stronger cola flavor and, for some reason, my taste buds perceived a hint of lemon.''<ref>{{cite web|author=Marvo |title=Review: Pepsi Next |url= http://www.theimpulsivebuy.com/wordpress/2012/03/25/review-pepsi-next/ |publisher=The Impulsive Buy |date=25 March 2012 |accessdate=8 March 2013 }}</ref>

According to the BevReview, the initial taste of Pepsi Next is similar to original Pepsi, but this is followed by the less pleasant taste of artificial sweeteners.<ref>{{cite web|first=Steve |last=Tanner |title=Review: Pepsi Next|url= http://www.bevreview.com/2012/03/29/pepsi-next/|publisher=BevReview |date=29 March 2012 |accessdate=8 March 2013 }}</ref>

In the 2013 Super Bowl, Pepsi used its advertising minutes right before the halftime show (which featured Beyonce, a "brand ambassador" for Pepsi) to advertise Pepsi Next. The presentation by Pepsi (the halftime show plus the advertising) was unique in that it featured photos of Pepsi customers. Pepsi had asked customers to send in photos before the Super Bowl.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Pepsi puts public in Super Bowl spot; Consumers are pop stars with Beyonce; second spot features Pepsi Next|last = Zmuda|first = Natalie|date = 7 January 2013|journal = Advertising Age|accessdate = |doi = |pmid = |subscription = yes}}</ref>
