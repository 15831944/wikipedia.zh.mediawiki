'''居里定律'''是指在[[顺磁性|顺磁性]]材料中，材料的[[磁化强度|磁化强度]]大致与施加的[[磁场|磁场]]强度成正比。然而，若加热材料，则比值减小。对于固定场强的磁场，磁化率大致与[[温度|温度]]成反比。

:<math>\mathbf{M} = C \cdot \frac{\mathbf{B}}{T},</math>

其中
:<math>\mathbf{M}</math>是磁化强度
:<math>\mathbf{B}</math>是[[磁感应强度|磁感应强度]]
:<math>T</math>是温度，以[[开尔文|开尔文]]为单位
:<math>C</math>是材料的[[居里常数|居里常数]]

居里定律是在实验中由[[皮埃尔·居里|皮埃尔·居里]]得到的，它适用于相对高温及弱磁场的条件下。而从其物理本源上推导，则能得到在低温和强磁场条件下，磁化强度趋于饱和的结果，而非由定律预言的持续增加。

A simple [[Mathematical_model|model]] of a [[paramagnet|paramagnet]] concentrates on the particles which compose it which do not interact with each other. Each particle has a [[magnetic_moment|magnetic moment]] given by <math>\vec{\mu}</math>. The [[energy|energy]] of a [[magnetic_moment|magnetic moment]] in a magnetic field is given by

:<math>E=-\boldsymbol{\mu}\cdot\mathbf{B}.</math>

===Two-state (spin-½) particles ===
To simplify the [[calculation|calculation]], we are going to work with a '''2-state''' particle: it may either align its magnetic moment with the magnetic field, or against it. So the only possible values of magnetic moment are then <math>\mu</math> and <math>-\mu</math>. If so, then such a particle has only two possible energies

:<math>E_0 = - \mu B</math>

and

:<math>E_1 = \mu B.</math>

When one seeks the magnetization of a paramagnet, one is interested in the likelihood of a particle to align itself with the field. In other words, one seeks the [[expectation_value|expectation value]] of the magnetization <math>\mu</math>:
:<math>\left\langle\mu\right\rangle = \mu P\left(\mu\right) + (-\mu) P\left(-\mu\right) 
 = {1 \over Z} \left( \mu e^{ \mu B\beta} - \mu e^{ - \mu B\beta} \right)
 = {2\mu \over Z} \sinh( \mu B\beta), </math>
where the [[probability|probability]] of a configuration is given by its [[Boltzmann_factor|Boltzmann factor]], and 
the [[Partition_function_(statistical_mechanics)|partition function]] <math>Z</math> provides the necessary [[Normalizing_constant|normalization]] for probabilities (so that the [[summation|sum]] of all of them is unity.) 
The partition function of one particle is:
:<math>Z = \sum_{n=0,1} e^{-E_n\beta} = e^{ \mu B\beta} + e^{-\mu B\beta} = 2 \cosh\left(\mu B\beta\right).</math>

Therefore, in this simple case we have:
:<math>\left\langle\mu\right\rangle = \mu \tanh\left(\mu B\beta\right).</math>

This is magnetization of one particle, the total magnetization of the [[solid|solid]] is given by

<blockquote style="border: 1px solid black; padding:10px;">
<math>M = n\left\langle\mu\right\rangle = n \mu \tanh\left({\mu B\over k T}\right)</math></blockquote>
where ''n'' is the [[number_density|number density]] of magnetic moments. The [[formula|formula]] above is known as the [[Langevin_paramagnetic_equation|Langevin paramagnetic equation]].
[[Pierre_Curie|Pierre Curie]] found an approximation to this [[law|law]] which applies to the relatively high temperatures and low magnetic fields used in his [[experiment|experiment]]s. Let's see what happens to the magnetization as we specialize it to large <math>T</math> and small <math>B</math>. As temperature increases and magnetic field decreases, the argument of [[hyperbolic_tangent|hyperbolic tangent]] decreases. Another way to say this is

:<math>\left({\mu B\over k T}\right) \ll 1</math>

this is sometimes called the '''Curie regime'''. We also know that if <math>|x| \ll 1</math>, then
:<math>\tanh x \approx x</math>
so
<blockquote style="border: 1px solid black; padding:10px;">
:<math>\mathbf{M}(T\rightarrow\infty)={n\mu^2\over k}{\mathbf{B}\over T},</math></blockquote>

with a [[Curie_constant|Curie constant]] given by <math>C= n\mu^2/k</math>.

In the regime of low temperatures or high fields, <math>M</math> tends to a maximum value of <math>n\mu</math>,
corresponding to all the particles being completely aligned with the field.  Since this calculation doesn't describe the electrons embedded deep within the Fermi surface, forbidden by the Pauli Exclusion principle to flip their spins, it does not exemplify the quantum statistics of the problem at low temperatures.  Using the Fermi-Dirac distribution, one will find that at low temperatures <math>M</math> is linear dependent on the magnetic field, so that the magnetic susceptibility saturates to a constant.

=== General case ===

When the particles have an arbitrary spin (any number of spin states), the formula is a bit more complicated.
At low magnetic fields or high temperature, the spin follows Curie's law, with
:<math>C = \frac{\mu_B^2}{3 k_B}n g^2 J(J+1)</math><ref>{{cite book | last = Kittel | first = Charles | title = Introduction to Solid State Physics, 8th Edition | publisher = Wiley | pages = 304 | isbn = 0-471-41526-X}}</ref>
where <math>J</math> is the [[total_angular_momentum_quantum_number|total angular momentum quantum number]] and <math>g</math> is the spin's g-factor (such that <math>\mu = g J \mu_B</math> is the magnetic moment).

For this more general formula and its derivation (including high field, low temperature) see the article: [[Brillouin_function|Brillouin function]].
As the spin approaches infinity, the formula for the magnetization approaches the classical value derived in the following section.

An alternative treatment applies when the paramagnetons are imagined to be classical, freely-rotating magnetic moments. In this case, their [[position_(vector)|position]] will be determined by their [[angle|angle]]s in [[spherical_coordinates|spherical coordinates]], and the energy for one of them will be:

:<math>E = - \mu B\cos\theta, </math>

where <math>\theta</math> is the angle between the magnetic moment and
the magnetic field (which we take to be pointing in the <math>z</math>
coordinate.) The corresponding partition function is

:<math>Z = \int_0^{2\pi} d\phi \int_0^{\pi}d\theta \sin\theta \exp( \mu B\beta \cos\theta).</math>

We see there is no dependence on the <math>\phi</math> angle, and also we can
change variables to <math>y=\cos\theta</math> to obtain

:<math>Z = 2\pi \int_{-1}^ 1 d y \exp( \mu B\beta y) =
2\pi{\exp( \mu B\beta )-\exp(-\mu B\beta ) \over \mu B\beta }=
{4\pi\sinh( \mu B\beta ) \over \mu B\beta .}
</math>

Now, the expected value of the <math>z</math> component of the magnetization (the other two are seen to be null (due to integration over <math>\phi</math>), as they should) will be given by

:<math>\left\langle\mu_z \right\rangle = {1 \over Z} \int_0^{2\pi} d\phi \int_0^{\pi}d\theta \sin\theta \exp( \mu B\beta \cos\theta) \left[\mu\cos\theta\right] .</math>

To simplify the calculation, we see this can be written as a differentiation of <math>Z</math>:

:<math>\left\langle\mu_z\right\rangle = {1 \over Z \beta} \frac{\partial Z}{\partial B} = {1 \over \beta} \frac{\partial \ln Z}{\partial B}</math>
(This approach can also be used for the model above, but the calculation was so simple this
is not so helpful.)

Carrying out the derivation we find

:<math>\left\langle\mu_z\right\rangle = \mu L(\mu B\beta), </math>

where <math>L</math> is the [[Langevin_function|Langevin function]]:

:<math> L(x)= \coth x -{1 \over x}.</math>

This function would appear to be singular for small <math>x</math>, but it is not, 
since the two singular terms cancel each other. In fact, its behavior for small arguments is
<math>L(x) \approx x/3</math>, so the Curie limit also applies, but with a Curie constant
three times smaller in this case. Similarly, the function saturates at <math>1</math> for large values of its argument, and the opposite limit is likewise recovered.
