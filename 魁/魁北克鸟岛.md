The Bonaventure Island has been an important source of  inspiration to numerous artists and poets. The surrealist writer [[André_Breton|André Breton]] declared that, while working on his novel  ''Arcane 17'', as he stayed in Percé (1944), he would never tire watching the birds of the Island.<ref>« J'ai beaucoup regardé les oiseaux dans cette île Bonaventure qui est au large de Percé. » André Breton, Radio-Canada, 13-1-1953; ''Vie des Arts'', XX, 8, Automn 1975, p. 17.</ref>  The Island never ceased to attract  painters and writers : the American painter Frederick James (d. 1905),  Franco-Germans Claire et [[Yvan_Goll|Yvan Goll]] (1946), etc., — by the sixties several artists would spend the summer on the Island, and would stay over the summer with the inhabitants -descendants of Irish and Norman settlers- the best known of whom was the naturalist William Du Val. Among these inspired visitors: painter Jacques Hurtubise <ref>Hurtubise painted « Les Mouillures » on the Island. See Jean Sarrazin, « Jacques Hurtubise», ''La Presse'', 11 February 1961, p. 30.</ref> and Kittie Bruneau,<ref>Residency from 1961 à 1972. Cf. « Kittie Bruneau.
