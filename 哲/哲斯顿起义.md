'''哲斯顿起义'''（{{lang-en|Jesselton Revolt}}，也被称为'''亚庇双十节起义'''）是由郭益南领导本地[[马来西亚华人|华人]]和其他族群组成的亚庇游击队于[[英属婆罗洲日占时期|英属婆罗洲日占时期]]进行的起义运动。这次行动使大约50至90名日本士兵丧命，并暂时控制了北婆罗洲首府亚庇和[[斗亚兰|斗亚兰]]的几个邻近地区。但面对军火供应有限的情况，游击队在之后被迫退到隐藏处躲藏。日军随后于西海岸的定居点通过[[日本宪兵|日本宪兵]]发动了一系列袭击，以抓拿游击队，并在搜寻中杀害了许多无辜平民。日军威胁将处决更多平民使游击队的首领最终决定自首投降，他们被逮捕和处决后，日军继续掌控北婆罗洲，直到1945年盟军解放军抵达。

== 背景 ==
[[File:AlbertKwok.JPG|thumb]]
由于日军占领期间队人民采取严厉的统治，使北婆罗洲西海岸发生了一些反抗事件，并出现了由郭益南（Albert Kwok）领导的游击队，其成员主要是[[马来西亚华人|马来西亚华人]]和一些[[原住民|原住民]]{{sfn|Tarling|2001|pp=196}}{{sfn|Ham|2013|pp=166}}。郭益南是一名来自[[砂拉越王国|砂拉越王国]][[古晋|古晋]]的[[潮汕民系|潮州]]人 ，曾在1940年通过[[英属马来亚|英属马来亚]]回到婆罗洲前参与[[中國國民黨|中國國民黨]][[蔣中正|蔣中正]]所领导的[[中華民國紅十字會|中華民國紅十字會]] {{sfn|Tregonning|1960|pp=88}}{{sfn|Danny|1998|pp=154}}{{sfn|Goodwin|1953|pp=31}}{{sfn|Evans|1990|pp=50}}。<!--这里暂时不翻译，欢迎各位协助During his time in China, Kwok was also a student of the [[List_of_Seventh-day_Adventist_secondary_schools|Seventh-day Adventist Mission School]] in [[广州市|广州市]]. He arrived on Jesselton on 15 May 1941 and started a practice treating [[痔疮|痔疮]].{{sfn|Danny|1998|pp=154}}{{sfn|Julitta|2005|pp=312}}

In February 1942, Kwok want to establish contact with the Australians or Americans in eastern North Borneo but was unable to walk across the island jungle more further when he reached [[Pensiangan|Pensiangan]] where he saw a large presence of Japanese troops.{{sfn|Tregonning|1960|pp=88}} He need to establish relations with the Allied movements, especially the [[United_States_Army_Forces_in_the_Far_East|United States Forces in the Philippines]] (USFIP) as it is the only sole armed resistance movement in the region at the time which are supplied with firearms.{{sfn|Kratoska|2013|pp=124}} After managed to establishing contact with the American forces in the Philippines with the help of fellow Chinese businessman named Lim Keng Fatt,{{sfn|Kratoska|2013|pp=124}}{{sfn|Reece|1998|pp=162}} a Muslim cleric (''[[伊玛目|伊玛目]]'') named Marajukim from [[蘇祿省|蘇祿省]] who is part of the [[Japanese_occupation_of_the_Philippines|resistance movement]] in the [[菲律賓自由邦|菲律賓自由邦]] approached Kwok in Jesselton where he began to depart to [[塔威塔威省|塔威塔威省]] for training.{{sfn|Julitta|2005|pp=318}} From there, they travel further to Sulu and met [[中校|中校]] Alejandro Suarez and learned the activities of the resistance movement in the archipelago.{{sfn|Kratoska|2013|pp=124}}{{sfn|Evans|1990|pp=52}}{{sfn|Dick|1983|pp=55}}

In May 1943, Kwok returned to Jesselton with a high determination to liberate North Borneo. Once he arrived there, he first contacted the Overseas Chinese Defence Association (OCDA), with whose help he acquired medical equipment and cash donations for the support of the resistance in Sulu.{{sfn|Evans|1990|pp=51}} Once again, in June 1943, he travelled with Marajukim to the Philippines. Through the mediation of Suarez, he met with the representatives of the US army and was appointed Lieutenant on 1 July 1943.{{sfn|Julitta|2005|pp=328}} The second time he return to North Borneo, Kwok already get three pistols, a box of hand [[手榴弹|手榴弹]]s and was promised to be given more weapons.{{sfn|Kratoska|2013|pp=125}} However, as he could not induce the guerrillas in the [[苏禄群岛|苏禄群岛]] to send more firearms, he was forced to launch a revolt with limited supplies.{{sfn|Tregonning|1960|pp=89}} A resistance group under his leadership was then established on 21 September 1943, with the group calling themselves as the Chinese National Salvation Association (CNSA),{{sfn|Danny|2004|pp=116}} a branch of the OCDA.{{sfn|Tregonning|1960|pp=89}} With collaboration between the Chinese and indigenous peoples, the group were subsequently known as Kinabalu Guerrillas Defence Force.{{sfn|Evans|1990|pp=52}}{{sfn|Kratoska|2013|pp=128}}

== Uprising ==
[[File:Petagas_Sabah_PetagasWarMemorial-05.jpg|thumb]]
As the Japanese decree to seize any opposition towards the Japanese administration became closer, the resistance group were forced to launch revolt ahead of schedule. With much of his members armed with only [[parang_(knife)|parang]], [[槍|槍]] and [[马来短剑|马来短剑]],{{sfn|Abbas|Bali|1985|pp=159}} the movement launched their attack from 9 October 1943 and temporarily retake Jesselton, [[Tuaran_District|Tuaran]] and [[Kota_Belud_District|Kota Belud]], leaving around 50–90 casualties on the Japanese side.{{sfn|Kratoska|2013|pp=111}}{{sfn|Luping|Chin|Dingley|1978|pp=40}}{{sfn|Ooi|1999|pp=56}} Through a combined land and sea attack on the Japanese, most islands inhabitants around the coastal areas contributed ships to the movement. Native [[巴瑶族|巴瑶族]]-[[Tausūg_people|Suluk]] leaders such as Panglima Ali ([[Sulug_Island|Sulug Island]]), Jemalul ([[Mantanani_Islands|Mantanani Islands]]), Orang Tua Arshad (Udar Island) and Saruddin ([[Dinawan_Island|Dinawan Island]]) contributed mostly through sea attacks.{{sfn|Ooi|2010|pp=164}}

Both Jemalul and Saruddin volunteered themselves from the Philippines to led the Binadans of Mantanani and the Dinawan Islands.{{sfn|Dick|1983|pp=47}} From land, the movement been supported by native [[Dusun_people|Dusun]]-[[Murut_people|Murut]] leaders such as Musah representing the Dusun community and Duallis for the Murut as well members of [[Indian_Imperial_Police|Indian Imperial Police]] led by Constable Subedar Dewa Singh.{{sfn|Ooi|2010|pp=164}} While administration and police members of authorities of North Borneo mostly serving under the North Borneo Volunteer Force (NBVF) led by Jules Stephens and Charles Peter,{{sfn|Ooi|2010|pp=164}} as well as [[中士|中士]] Bud Singh and [[下士|下士]] Sohan Singh.{{sfn|Hwang|2010}}

After the successful revolt, the resistance movement under OCDA and NBVF jointly hoisting the [[中華民國國旗|中華民國國旗]] and [[聯合傑克|聯合傑克]] on 10 October 1943.{{sfn|Kratoska|2013|pp=124}} Most of the members under OCDA are loyal to the [[中華民國_(大陸時期)|中華民國 (大陸時期)]] while NBVF remained loyal to the [[英国|英国]] although the NBVF are not even recognised by the British government.{{sfn|Kratoska|2013|pp=124}} While the Japanese reinforcement from Kuching are still in process, Kwok along with other members began to retreat into their hide-out and the OCDA celebrate the birthday of [[孫中山|孫中山]], the founder of Kuomintang and subsequently the Republic of China by hoisting the national flag again and singing the [[中華民國國歌|中華民國國歌]] on 12 November 1943.{{sfn|Kratoska|2013|pp=124}}

== Aftermath and legacy ==
[[File:Petagas_Sabah_PetagasWarMemorial-04.jpg|thumb]] built on the site of execution to honour the sacrifices of Kinabalu Guerrillas.]]
Following the arrival of Japanese reinforcement, the Japanese authorities subsequently launch a ruthless counter-offensive by bombing coastal settlements from Kota Belud until [[Membakut|Membakut]] and machine-gunning people.{{sfn|Ooi|1999|pp=56}}{{sfn|Ooi|2010|pp=186}} Almost all villages in the area burnt down with around 2,000–4,000 innocent civilians were executed, mostly being the Bajau-Suluk civilians.{{sfn|Ooi|2013|pp=77}}{{sfn|Kratoska|2013|pp=113}} After been threatened with more civilians will be killed if the leader of the uprising did not turned themselves in, Kwok finally surrendered with several of his top members where he and some 175 peoples who for the most part had nothing to do with the uprising are subjected to execution order of the Japanese on 21 January 1944 in Petagas, [[Putatan|Putatan]].{{sfn|Danny|2004|pp=116}} 

After the war, the [[远东国际军事法庭|远东国际军事法庭]] (IMTFE) that was set-up in 1946 concludes that during the resistance movement that was led by the Chinese and indigenous peoples in North Borneo, the ''Kenpeitai'' are involved in the reign of terror by arresting, torturing and massacre hundreds of Chinese revolt members while doing an apparently systematic extermination of coastal population that was inhabited by the Suluk people.{{sfn|Watt|1985|pp=210}}{{sfn|Thurman|Sherman|2001|pp=123}} The sacrifice of the movement were honoured with a memorial in Petagas.-->
