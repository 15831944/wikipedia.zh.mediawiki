== 故事簡介 ==
在電影版《'''魔髮奇緣'''》的故事發生6個月後，重返科洛納王國的[[樂佩公主|樂佩]]漸漸熟悉跟父母以及王國百姓的生活。在嶄新的日子裡，樂佩與尤金都實現了自己原先的夢想，開始要思考人生的下一個方向。樂佩離開高塔並與父母重逢，現在則開始要學習擔負身為公主的職責，迎接正式的加冕典禮。而尤金如願以償地住在他過去所嚮往的大城堡中，接著開始計畫著要向樂佩求婚，希望能與她一起過上幸福美滿的下半輩子。

但是對生性活潑外向的樂佩而言，拘謹的皇室禮儀與規則讓她感到難以適應，也使樂佩產生了有別於過去高塔生活的束縛感。而由於樂佩被綁走過的過去，國王對她保護可說是嚴謹到有些過頭，即便樂佩要到街道上放鬆遊玩，也被一大隊士兵包圍，無法自由地與外界接觸。連日的壓力下，樂佩已經厭倦了城堡里時時刻刻被衛兵保護和監視下的生活，而且在加冕日前一晚的宴會上面對尤金的求婚，那句「一輩子都在城堡裡一起生活」的誓言更讓樂佩產生被約束的恐懼，不知所措的她拒絕了尤金的求婚。

拒絕尤金讓樂佩非常混亂。尤金無疑是自己願意共度一生的摯愛，但她還沒準備好面對婚姻的束縛。心情低落下驅使自己與侍女兼好朋友卡珊卓拉一起溜出科洛納王國的城墻外散心，期間樂佩走到當年魔法黃金花生長的地方，無意接觸了一種神秘的黑色石頭後，她70英呎長的金色長髮又長回來了，而且還變得堅不可摧。同時黑色石頭也開始失控地生長，並緩慢地逼近科洛納王國主城。此後，樂佩、尤金和卡珊卓拉一起展開了全新的冒險。

| ShortSummary    = Six months after the events of ''[[Tangled|Tangled]]'', Rapunzel is settling into life in the kingdom of Corona, but is unable to enjoy her life with the constant protection of her father's guards. When she and her lady-in-waiting, Cassandra, sneak out of the castle, they come upon some magical black rock spikes that magically bring back her long blonde hair (which is now indestructable, so Rapunzel has to hide it from everyone, especially her parents). Eventually, Eugene, Maximus and Pascal find out about the hair as well, but Rapunzel decides not to tell Eugene about how she got her hair back (because Cassandra doesn't trust him), a decision which he hardly agrees with. Rapunzel manages to hide her hair from her parents, but becomes very nervous because of her coronation day. To complicate matters, a female rogue, Lady Caine, appears at Rapunzel's coronation with a hatred of King Frederic who had taken away her father a long time ago. With no other choice, Rapunzel reveals her new 70-feet long hair and, with her friends' help, defeats the thugs. Later, that night, Rapunzel admits to her father that she had snuck out of the castle (but doesn't mention anything about Cassandra helping her), so King Fredric has no other choice, but to forbid Rapunzel from leaving the walls of Corona. Rapunzel feels trapped again (just like in her old tower), but with her mother's encouragement, she decides to take her relationship and role in Corona one day at a time.

A little while later, a mysterious individual comes across the site of the magical flower that cured Rapunzel's mother and was the original source of her magical long blonde hair.  We see now there is nothing left, but even more mysterious black rock spikes covering the area.

| ShortSummary    = Rapunzel and Cassandra seek out an alchemist in their first attempt of solving the mystery as to how and why Rapunzel's golden 70-feet hair grew back. Eugene follows them but things don't go quite as planned: they find Varian, a 14 years old alchemist who agrees to help uncover the mystery of Rapunzel's hair. However, Varian had built some underground machines which get out of control and destroy the village. Luckily, no one gets hurt and the test shows some important facts about Rapunzel's hair: it's completely indestructable and doesn't have any healing powers anymore, but now can completely cover somebody and protect him (shown when the hair became a giant ball around Rapunzel and Eugene which protected them from the rubble). As they leave, Rapunzel begins telling Eugene about the events of the night when her hair grew back (which Eugene promises to keep secret) and the black rocks slowly start growing back and multiply themselves.

| ShortSummary    = During the annual Gopher Festival, Rapunzel is booed by a man in the crowd when she shows her new emblem to the people of Corona. After finding out that the person who booed her is an eldery shopkeeper who everyone loves, Rapunzel is determined to uncover Uncle Monty's disapproval of her, even if it means disguising herself. Eventually she inspires Monty to participate at the Gopher Festival Tournament, but during the race she has to rescue him from a waterfall, resulting in blowing her disguise. Monty tells her that he boooed her because he doesn't like all these new changes in the kingdom that occurred due to her return as a princess and the two remain enemies, but respect each other. Monty wins the race and Rapunzel booos him as a sign of their "special relationship". At his sweets shop, Monty looks very proud at his trophy, realising he wouldn't have won if it hadn't been Rapunzel to help him follow his dream.

But Quirin doesn't say anything about the rocks, so Varian talks to Rapunzel who promises to help him with this problem. The following day, Rapunzel takes over the kingdom while her parents go away for their anniversary. Unfortunately, every royal decision she makes to help the people of Corona backfires badly. Meanwhile, Varian starts testing the mystical rocks, but his father tells him to stay away and refuses to tell him anything. As if anything couldn't go worse at the castle, a blizzard strikes Corona, resulting in everyone loking inside their houses, as well as an accident in the mountains, trapping Frederic and Arianna. With her parents in danger, Rapunzel takes one of the hardest decision and sends Eugene and the other thugs to rescue them. In the meantime, one of Varian's experiments result in the rocks trapping Quirin inside them and Varian rushing to the castle to ask for Rapunzel's help. On the way there he sings about hoping to make his father proud, but when he gets there Rapunzel makes another hard decision and tells him that she can't help him right now, resulting in Varian returning home, feeling betrayed. Left with no other choice, Rapunzel orders the evacuation of the island, but then remembers about the legend told earlier by Xavier about an underground machine built by the wizard Lord Demanitus, with the power to change the way of the blizzard. Rapunzel, Cassandra, Xavier and Pascal find the machine and Pascal almost gets killed in order to turn it on. With the machine activated, the blizzard disappears, the evacuation is canceled, Frederic and Arianna are saved and everything is back to normal. Back at the castle, Rapunzel confesses to Eugene that it was the hardest day of her life due to all the hard decisions she had to made, but Eugene cheers her up saying that there is still much time until she will become queen and enjoy her life until then. In a final scene, Quirin is completely trapped inside the rocks, holding a message for Varian who, saddened, swears to release his father at any costs and get revenge on everyone who stands in his way.

| ShortSummary    = On Rapunzel's 19th birthday, Corona is beset by an automaton attack from Varian, which causes Frederic to lock Rapunzel in her room to keep her safe from further danger. Eugene and Cassandra help break her out to go after Varian, but the alchemist uses his pet raccoon, mutated as a wild beast, to assault the kingdom, incapacitating many of the Royal Guards and using the chaos to kidnap Arianna, whom he uses as leverage to lure Rapunzel to Old Corona. Led by Cassandra, Eugene, Rapunzel, and Frederic, the Royal Guards lay siege to Varian's house, who uses automatons to keep them at bay. Varian attempts to use Rapunzel's hair to free his father, but it is of no use. Angry and with nothing left to lose, he uses a giant automaton to attack, threatening to kill Cassandra and Arianna. Rapunzel, however, uses her connection to the black rocks to defeat Varian, who is arrested for his crimes and vows vengeance. Rapunzel notices that the rocks are now pointing away from Corona and towards an unknown destination beyond the border wall, a path which Rapunzel is encouraged to follow. In a post-credits scene, a mysterious warrior arrives and uses a special sword to slice through the seemingly impenetrable black rocks.
