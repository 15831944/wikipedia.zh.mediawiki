 |ShortSummary    = Will, Charlie, and Mac are trying to convince Leona and her son Reese to accept their resignations. Taylor Warren, formerly with the Romney campaign, is on the ACN election night panel. She gives Maggie a tip about a candidate in California who has condemned [[Todd_Akin|Todd Akin]], but made a similarly [[Rape_and_pregnancy_controversies_in_United_States_elections,_2012|controversial statement]] several years ago about rape and abortion. The candidate's staff, in order to get ACN to not run the story, gives them a tip that CIA Director [[David_Petraeus|David Petraeus]] will resign because of an [[Petraeus_scandal|affair]] and that the Commander of US Forces in Afghanistan will be investigated for a relationship with a [[Jill_Kelley|Florida socialite]], who was receiving harassing e-mails from [[Paula_Broadwell|Petraeus' mistress]]. Sloan discovers a supposedly autographed copy of her book was sold at a charity auction, but she did not actually sign it and asks Neal to track down the buyer. Mac asks Neal to fix the information listed on her Wikipedia page which wrongly states that she was President of the [[Oxford_Union|Oxford Union]] when she actually went to [[University_of_Cambridge|Cambridge]], but he has trouble finding an outside source to confirm the information. Don is told by Rebecca Halliday that he will be named in a separate lawsuit by Jerry Dantana. Jim accidentally calls a race too early and spends the night watching it, hoping he will end up being correct. Will tells Mac that she will be fired at the end of the election night show. Takes place on [[Election_Day_(United_States)|Election Night]], November 6, 2012.

 <!-- |ShortSummary    = Experiencing a loss of viewer trust from the Genoa retraction, the news team treats a breaking story about the [[Boston_Marathon_bombings|Boston Marathon bombings]] with guarded caution. Maggie and Elliot are sent to Boston, and after he has an allergic reaction, she steps in to report in impressive fashion. Sloan, using a computer program that allows her to review financial information in great detail, follows a tip from a friend about a company that may be bought out. Reese gives Sloan data showing heavy losses, but asks her to "be kind" and think big picture when she reports on the company. Neal is contacted by an anonymous source and given a file containing confidential and stolen documents regarding riots overseas. Neal asks his source to send two more documents, and teaches the source how to do it. When they learn of this, Reese, Neal, Charlie, Mac, and Will realize that Neal has likely and inadvertently assisted in committing [[espionage|espionage]]. Will, informed that ACN has dropped to fourth in the ratings, suggests that he quit.  Sloan figures out that the company being taken over is AWM itself, and that they will be the victim of a hostile takeover by Reese's two half-siblings. Jim informs everyone that the second suspect in the bombings was found in a boat in someone's backyard, and Will replies that they'd better get confirmation before he goes on the air to say that. Will backtracks on his resignation, stating that they will stand behind Reese, then tells Neal to get legal representation. Takes place between April 15 and April 19, 2013.-->

<!--  |ShortSummary    = Charlie and Reese confront Reese's half-siblings, Randy and Blair ([[Kat_Dennings|Kat Dennings]]), about their hostile takeover. After some heated back-and-forth, Leona arrives and offers to buy their shares for a higher price. Neal and Will meet Rebecca Halliday to discuss Neal's legal situation and she confirms that he has committed espionage. She and Will agree that ACN should not run the story. Mac asks her friend, Molly ([[Mary_McCormack|Mary McCormack]]), an [[FBI|FBI]] agent, about espionage charges and the media. Molly tells her that reporters are never charged with espionage but can be charged with [[Contempt_of_court|contempt]]. Mac tells Rebecca, Will and Neal they have to run the story. Returning from Boston, Maggie overhears an [[EPA|EPA]] official, Richard ([[Paul_Lieberstein|Paul Lieberstein]]), on the phone with a reporter, making [[Off_the_record_(journalism)|off-the-record]] disparaging remarks about the President. Maggie reveals that she overheard, but Richard makes her feel that she's violated ethics and she tells him she won't use any of the story. Richard then gives her an exclusive story and a report that [[carbon_dioxide_levels|carbon dioxide levels]] are higher than they have been for millions of years. Don informs Sloan that he purchased stock prior to Sloan reporting it in a newscast. Sloan fears that since they are a couple, it is against the ACN handbook. Sloan inadvertently informs Jim that she's been sleeping with Don. Hallie sends a middle-of-the-night tweet from the ACN account making a joke in poor taste about the Boston Marathon and Republicans. Though she quickly deletes it, other news sources pick it up and Charlie fires her. After the ACN senior staff discuss Neal's situation with Rebecca, Will realizes that Neal has already confirmed a portion of the leak (concerning [[The_West_Wing#Foreign|Equatorial Kundu]]), forcing ACN's hand. Will has Neal give him the name of his source, then tells him how to get out of town. As the FBI execute a [[search_warrant|search warrant]] on ACN computers, Molly informs Mac, Will and Charlie that Neal will likely be charged with espionage if he is found to have assisted the source in any way. Neal escapes the building, destroying his phone and the note Will gave him telling him to run. Takes place on April 20, 2013.-->

Don meets the new [[Human_resources|HR]] rep, Wyatt ([[Keith_Powell|Keith Powell]]), who believes Don and Sloan are in a relationship. Maggie's segment on the EPA report goes to air with Will interviewing Richard. However, the interview does not go well, as Richard continually remarks that the effect of human {{CO2}} emissions into the atmosphere is unchangeable. Will, Mac, Charlie, and Rebecca meet the Attorney General's representative in Washington to discuss Neal's situation, but Will does not offer up any information other than describing how he orchestrated much of the situation himself. At the [[White_House_Correspondents'_Dinner|White House Correspondents' Dinner]], Charlie has a meeting with Lucas to discuss buying the network, Mac is approached by a woman named Lily ([[Clea_DuVall|Clea DuVall]]) who says, and then confirms, that she is Neal's source, and Will is subpoenaed to appear before a grand jury.

The story is ready to air but Reese says they cannot run it. Pruit tells the team his new vision for the company, including user-generated content, which Charlie does not like. Sloan and Don keep dodging the human resources rep, however he already knows they are dating. Sloan and Charlie try to find another buyer for ACN, but are unsuccessful when they find out the new buyer has just been using them as leverage to buy another company. Jim and Hallie fight over their views of journalism and break up after she writes about a fight they had for her new online column. Will continues to defy the government by refusing to name the source of the stolen documents and is held in [[contempt_of_court|contempt]] and sentenced to jail. Before he goes to jail, he and Mac get married at the courthouse. Takes place between April 27 and May 3, 2013.-->

<!-- |ShortSummary    = ACN continues its charge towards younger ratings by sending Don out to get a story on [[campus_rape|campus rape]] and the internet reporting of rape, and having Sloan interview Neal's temporary replacement about ACN's new celebrity sighting/stalking [[Mobile_app|app]]. Will, still serving his contempt detention for refusing to reveal his source, has a troubling conversation with a new cell mate ([[Kevin_Rankin_(actor)|Kevin Rankin]]), who is later revealed, through a picture of young Will and his father, to be Will's vision of his dead father. Jim and Maggie attempt a fruitless search for [[Edward_Snowden|Edward Snowden]] at a Russian airport, eventually end up on a false-alarm 13-hour plane flight. Over the course of the flight, they finally confront each other over their obvious mutual attraction, with Jim demanding to know why Maggie hasn't recognised that he likes her for so long, and Maggie in turn retorting that she broke up with Don long before he started dating Hallie, and he therefore had no reason not to pursue her then. To escape the resulting awkwardness, Jim changes seats with another passenger, but Maggie, after thinking things through, eventually gets him to return to his original seat beside her so that she can kiss him. Sloan discredits Neal's temporary replacement on the air, and Pruit, the new owner, fires Sloan and Mac. Charlie informs Pruit that only he has the power to fire anyone in the newsroom, and, on the way to talk about the situation privately with Pruit, has a heart attack. When newsroom staff run to his aid, the title song "[[Oh_Shenandoah|Oh Shenandoah]]", which could earlier be heard during Don's campus interview, is heard again. As Will is released from prison, he is told by Mac that Charlie has died. Takes place between May 3 and June 24, 2013.-->

<!-- |ShortSummary    = Set around Charlie's funeral service and wake, a series of flashbacks show how his vision created the new format for ''News Night'', how he hired Mac, how Mac told the young student at Will's first episode question and answer scene how to be the first at the microphone to ask a question, how Charlie led Will into becoming a better journalist, and other pre-series situations including Don and Sloan's first meeting. Neal returns from Venezuela and is disappointed at how the new team is running ACN Digital and tells them they are going to rebuild it. Leona talks Pruit into rectifying his emerging negative image with women by hiring Mac as the network president, replacing Charlie. Mac and Will find out that she is pregnant, and Will quits smoking as a result. Mac makes Jim the show's executive producer after offering the job to Don, who chooses to stay with and improve the 10 o'clock news show. After Jim arranges for Maggie to be offered a field producer's job in D.C., she misinterprets this as a comment that their relationship, causing further tension between them. Sloan, fed up with watching them misinterpret each other's actions, intervenes, and they eventually conclude that they have allowed their relationship to progress too rapidly since they kissed on the plane three days earlier. Although Jim offers her the senior producer position after he fills Mac's old job, she decides to take the field producer position after all, and they make plans to continue their relationship long-distance; Maggie questions why this will succeed if Jim's previous long-distance relationships failed, and is caught off guard with his response: "I wasn't in love with them." The newsroom staff prepare and broadcast their next ''News Night''. Takes place on June 27, 2013. Flashbacks take place three years earlier in 2010.-->
