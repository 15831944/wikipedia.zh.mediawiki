其原因是多方面的。通常它發生是因為腎[[组织_(生物学)|組織]]損壞造成的，其起因為任何病因(例如[[低血壓|低血壓]])[[腎血流量|腎血流量]]的減少(腎[[缺血|缺血]](ischemia))、暴露於[[中毒性腎損害|對腎有害的物質]](Nephrotoxicity)、腎[[炎症|發炎]]的過程，或阻塞尿流量的[[泌尿系統|尿路]]阻礙。AKI診斷是基於特有的實驗室研究結果上、如升高的[[尿素氮|尿素氮]]及[[肌酸酐|肌酸酐]]，或[[寡尿|腎臟不能產生足夠量的尿]]。

AKI可能導致一些[[併發症|併發症]]，包括[[代謝性酸中毒|代謝性酸中毒]](Metabolic acidosis)、[[高鉀血症|高鉀血症]]，[[尿毒症|尿毒症]]、身體[[體液平衡|體液平衡]](Fluid balance)的改變，並影響到其它的[[生物系統|器官系統]]。治療方法包括支持性看護，如[[腎替代治療法|腎替代治療法]](Renal replacement therapy)，以及潛在病症的治療。

===腎前性===
AKI''腎前性''的原因(腎前[[氮質血症|氮質血症]](Azotemia))是那些有效降低[[腎血流量|血液流向腎臟]]。<!--These include systemic causes, such as [[hypovolemia|low blood volume]], [[hypotension|low blood pressure]], [[heart_failure|heart failure]], [[liver_cirrhosis|liver cirrhosis]] and local changes to the blood vessels supplying the kidney. The latter include [[renal_artery_stenosis|renal artery stenosis]], or the narrowing of the [[renal_artery|renal artery]] which supplies the kidney with blood, and [[renal_vein_thrombosis|renal vein thrombosis]], which is the formation of a [[thrombus|blood clot]] in the [[renal_vein|renal vein]] that drains blood from the kidney.

[[Renal_ischaemia|Renal ischaemia]] ultimately results in functional disorder, depression of [[Glomerular_filtration_rate|GFR]], or both. These causes stem from the inadequate cardiac output and hypovolemia or vascular diseases causing reduced perfusion of  both kidneys. Both kidneys need to be affected as one kidney is still more than adequate for normal kidney function.-->

===固有性===<!--
Sources of damage to the kidney itself are dubbed ''intrinsic''. Intrinsic AKI can be due to damage to the [[glomerulus_(kidney)|glomeruli]], [[nephron|renal tubules]], or [[interstitium|interstitium]]. Common causes of each are [[glomerulonephritis|glomerulonephritis]], [[acute_tubular_necrosis|acute tubular necrosis]] (ATN), and [[acute_interstitial_nephritis|acute interstitial nephritis]] (AIN), respectively. A cause of intrinsic acute renal failure is [[tumor_lysis_syndrome|tumor lysis syndrome]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Jim Cassidy, Donald Bissett, Roy A. J. Spence, Miranda Payne|first=|title=Oxford Handbook of Oncology |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=WKoQW4G0g14C&pg=PA706&dq=tumour+lysis+syndrome+acute+renal+failure&hl=en&sa=X&ei=lbigT8KJPMeEgwehjfWmCQ&ved=0CFYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=tumour%20lysis%20syndrome%20acute%20renal%20failure&f=false|date=1 January 2010|publisher=[[Oxford_University_Press|Oxford University Press]]|page=706}}</ref>-->

===腎後性===<!--
''Postrenal'' AKI is a consequence of [[urinary_tract|urinary tract]] obstruction. This may be related to [[benign_prostatic_hyperplasia|benign prostatic hyperplasia]], [[kidney_stone|kidney stone]]s, obstructed [[urinary_catheter|urinary catheter]], bladder stone, bladder, ureteral or renal malignancy. It is useful to perform a bladder scan or a post void residual to rule out urinary retention. In post void residual, a catheter is inserted immediately after urinating to measure fluid still in the bladder. 50-100 ml suggests [[neurogenic_bladder_dysfunction|neurogenic bladder dysfunction]]. A renal ultrasound will demonstrate hydronephrosis if present. A CT scan of the abdomen will also demonstrate bladder distension or hydronephrosis, however, in case of acute renal failure, the use of IV contrast is contraindicated. On the basic metabolic panel, the [[BUN-to-creatinine_ratio|ratio of BUN to creatinine]] may indicate post renal failure.-->

==診斷==
===檢測===
腎功能的惡化可通過測量尿量的減少被發現。<!--Often, it is diagnosed on the basis of [[blood_test|blood test]]s for substances normally eliminated by the kidney: [[urea|urea]] and [[creatinine|creatinine]]. Both tests have their disadvantages. For instance, it takes about 24 hours for the creatinine level to rise, even if both kidneys have ceased to function. A number of alternative markers has been proposed (such as [[NGAL|NGAL]], [[KIM-1|KIM-1]], [[Interleukin_18|IL18]] and [[cystatin_C|cystatin C]]), but none are currently established enough to replace creatinine as a marker of renal function.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Chawla|first=LS|author2=Kellum, JA|title=Acute kidney injury in 2011: Biomarkers are transforming our understanding of AKI.|journal=Nature Reviews Nephrology|date=Jan 17, 2012|volume=8|issue=2|pages=68–70|doi=10.1038/nrneph.2011.216|pmid=22249777}}</ref>
Use of the ''renal angina index'', a composite of risk factors and early signs of injury, has been used to detect fulfillment of [[renal_angina|renal angina]] in children.-->

===進一步檢測===<!--
Once the diagnosis of AKI is made, further testing is often required to determine the underlying cause. These may include urine sediment analysis, [[renal_ultrasound|renal ultrasound]] and/or [[kidney_biopsy|kidney biopsy]]. Indications for renal biopsy in the setting of AKI include:<ref name="isbn0-07-159124-9">{{cite book |author=Papadakis MA, McPhee SJ |title=Current Medical Diagnosis and Treatment |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional |location= |year=2008 |pages= |isbn=0-07-159124-9}}</ref>

==分類==<!--
Acute kidney injury is diagnosed on the basis of [[clinical_history|clinical history]] and laboratory data. A diagnosis is made when there is rapid reduction in [[renal_function|kidney function]], as measured by serum [[creatinine|creatinine]], or based on a rapid reduction in urine output, termed [[oliguria|oliguria]].-->

===定義===<!--
Introduced by the KDIGO in 2012,<ref>Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Acute Kidney Injury Work Group. KDIGO Clinical Practice Guideline for Acute Kidney Injury. Kidney inter.</ref> specific criteria exist for the diagnosis of AKI.

AKI can be diagnosed if any one of the following is present:
* Increase in SCr by ≥0.3 mg/dl (≥26.5 μmol/l) within 48 hours; or
* Increase in SCr to ≥1.5 times baseline, which have occurred within the prior 7 days; or
* Urine volume < 0.5 ml/kg/h for 6 hours.-->

The ''RIFLE criteria'', proposed by the [[Acute_Dialysis_Quality_Initiative|Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative]] (ADQI) group, aid in the staging of patients with AKI:<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bellomo R, Ronco C, Kellum JA, Mehta RL, Palevsky P |title=Acute renal failure - definition, outcome measures, animal models, fluid therapy and information technology needs: the Second International Consensus Conference of the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative (ADQI) Group |journal=Crit Care |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=R204–12 |year=2004 |pmid=15312219 |pmc=522841 |doi=10.1186/cc2872 |url=http://ccforum.com/content/8/4/R204}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Lameire N, Van Biesen W, Vanholder R |title=Acute renal failure |journal=[[The_Lancet|Lancet]] |volume=365 |issue=9457 |pages=417–30 |year=2005 |pmid=15680458 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)17831-3}}</ref>

* [[End-stage_renal_disease|End-stage renal disease]]: Complete loss of kidney function (e.g., need for renal replacement therapy) for more than three months-->

==治療==<!--
The management of AKI hinges on identification and treatment of the underlying cause. In addition to treatment of the underlying disorder, management of AKI routinely includes the avoidance of substances that are toxic to the kidneys, called [[nephrotoxin|nephrotoxin]]s. These include [[NSAID|NSAID]]s such as [[ibuprofen|ibuprofen]], [[iodinated_contrast|iodinated contrast]]s such as those used for [[CT_scan|CT scan]]s, many [[antibiotics|antibiotics]] such as [[gentamicin|gentamicin]], and a range of other substances.<ref name=pmid18492867 />

Monitoring of renal function, by serial serum creatinine measurements and monitoring of urine output, is routinely performed. In the hospital, insertion of a [[urinary_catheterization|urinary catheter]] helps monitor urine output and relieves possible bladder outlet obstruction, such as with an enlarged prostate.-->

===具體療法===<!--
In prerenal AKI without [[hypervolemia|fluid overload]], administration of [[intravenous_fluid|intravenous fluid]]s is typically the first step to improve renal function. Volume status may be monitored with the use of a [[central_venous_catheter|central venous catheter]] to avoid over- or under-replacement of fluid.

Should [[hypotension|low blood pressure]] prove a persistent problem in the fluid-replete patient, [[inotrope|inotrope]]s such as [[norepinephrine|norepinephrine]] and [[dobutamine|dobutamine]] may be given to improve [[cardiac_output|cardiac output]] and hence renal perfusion. While a useful pressor, there is no evidence to suggest that [[dopamine|dopamine]] is of any specific benefit,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Holmes CL, Walley KR |title=Bad medicine: low-dose dopamine in the ICU |journal=Chest |volume=123 |issue=4 |pages=1266–75 |year=2003 |pmid=12684320|doi=10.1378/chest.123.4.1266}}</ref> and may be harmful.

The myriad causes of intrinsic AKI require specific therapies. For example, intrinsic AKI due to [[Wegener's_granulomatosis|Wegener's granulomatosis]] may respond to [[steroid|steroid]] medication. Toxin-induced prerenal AKI often responds to discontinuation of the offending agent, such as [[aminoglycoside|aminoglycoside]], [[penicillin|penicillin]], NSAIDs, or [[paracetamol|paracetamol]].<ref name=Brady />

If the cause is obstruction of the urinary tract, relief of the obstruction (with a [[nephrostomy|nephrostomy]] or [[urinary_catheter|urinary catheter]]) may be necessary.-->

===利尿劑===<!--
The use of [[diuretics|diuretics]] such as [[furosemide|furosemide]], is widespread and sometimes convenient in ameliorating fluid overload.
