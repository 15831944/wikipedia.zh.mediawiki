==Protocol==

[[Image:Quantum_teleportation_diagram.PNG|300px]]

The prerequisites for quantum teleportation are a [[qubit|qubit]] that is to be teleported, a conventional [[communication_channel|communication channel]] capable of transmitting two classical bits (i.e., one of four states), and means of generating an [[Quantum_entanglement|entangled]] [[Bell_state|EPR pair]] of qubits, performing a [[Bell_measurement|Bell measurement]] on the EPR pair, and manipulating the quantum state of one of the pair.  The [[protocol_(computing)|protocol]] is then as follows:

1. An EPR pair is generated, one qubit sent to location A, the other to B.

2. At location A, a Bell measurement of the EPR pair qubit and the qubit to be teleported (for example, quantum state <math>|\phi \rangle</math> of a photon) is performed, yielding two classical bits of information.  Both qubits are destroyed.

3. Using the classical channel, the two bits are sent from A to B.  (This is the only potentially time-consuming step, due to speed-of-light considerations.)

4. At location B, the EPR pair qubit is modified (if necessary), using the two bits to select the correct one of four possible quantum states.  A qubit identical to that chosen for teleportation (for example, quantum state <math>|\phi \rangle</math> of a photon) results.

== Motivation ==

Suppose [[Alice_and_Bob|Alice]] has a [[qubit|qubit]] in some arbitrary [[quantum_state|quantum state]] <math>|\phi\rangle</math>. (A qubit may be represented as a [[Quantum_superposition|superposition]] of [[Quantum_state|states]], labeled <math>|0\rangle</math> and <math>|1\rangle</math>.) Assume that this quantum state is not known to Alice and she would like to send this state to Bob. Ostensibly, Alice has the following options:

# She can attempt to physically transport the qubit to Bob.
# She can broadcast this (quantum) information, and Bob can obtain the information via some suitable receiver.
# She can perhaps measure the unknown qubit in her possession. The results of this measurement would be communicated to Bob, who then prepares a qubit in his possession accordingly, to obtain the desired state. (This hypothetical process is called ''classical teleportation''.)

Option 1 is highly undesirable because quantum states are fragile and any perturbation en route would corrupt the state.

Option 2 is forbidden by the [[no-broadcast_theorem|no-broadcast theorem]].

Option 3 (classical teleportation) has also been formally shown to be impossible. (See the [[no_teleportation_theorem|no teleportation theorem]].) This is another way to say that quantum information cannot be measured reliably.

Thus, Alice seems to face an impossible problem. A solution was discovered by [http://www.research.ibm.com/quantuminfo/teleportation/teleportation.html Bennett, et al]. The components of a [[Maximally_entangled_state|maximally entangled]] two-qubit state are distributed to Alice and Bob. The protocol then involves Alice and Bob interacting locally with the qubit(s) in their possession and Alice sending two classical bits to Bob. In the end, the qubit in Bob's possession will be in the desired state.

== A summary ==
Assume that Alice and Bob share an entangled qubit ''ab''. That is, Alice has one half, ''a'', and Bob has the other half, ''b''. Let ''c'' denote the qubit Alice wishes to transmit to Bob.

Alice applies a unitary operation on the qubits ''ac'' and measures the result to obtain two classical bits. In this process, the two qubits are destroyed. Bob's qubit, ''b'', now contains information about ''c''; however, the information is somewhat randomized. More specifically, Bob's qubit ''b'' is in one of four states uniformly chosen at random and Bob cannot obtain any information about ''c'' from his qubit.

Alice provides her two measured classical bits, which indicate which of the four states Bob possesses. Bob applies a unitary transformation which depends on the classical bits he obtains from Alice, transforming his qubit into an identical re-creation of the qubit ''c''.

== The result ==
[[File:Quantum_teleportation_circuit.svg|300px]] representation of quantum teleportation]]

Suppose Alice has a qubit that she wants to teleport to Bob. This qubit can be written generally, in [[bra-ket_notation|bra-ket notation]], as:
<math>|\psi\rangle_C = \alpha |0\rangle_C + \beta|1\rangle_C.</math>

Our quantum teleportation scheme requires Alice and Bob to share a maximally [[quantum_entanglement|entangled]] state beforehand, for instance one of the four [[Bell_state|Bell state]]s

: <math>|\Phi^+\rangle_{AB} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|0\rangle_A \otimes |0\rangle_{B} + |1\rangle_A \otimes |1\rangle_{B})</math>,
: <math>|\Phi^-\rangle_{AB} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|0\rangle_A \otimes |0\rangle_{B} - |1\rangle_A \otimes |1\rangle_{B})</math>,
: <math>|\Psi^+\rangle_{AB} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|0\rangle_A \otimes |1\rangle_{B} + |1\rangle_A \otimes |0\rangle_{B})</math>,
: <math>|\Psi^-\rangle_{AB} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|0\rangle_A \otimes |1\rangle_{B} - |1\rangle_A \otimes |0\rangle_{B})</math>.

Alice takes one of the particles in the pair, and Bob keeps the other one. The subscripts ''A'' and ''B'' in the entangled state refer to Alice's or Bob's particle. We will assume that Alice and Bob share the entangled state <math>|\Phi^+\rangle_{AB}.</math>

So, Alice has two particles (''C'', the one she wants to teleport, and ''A'', one of the entangled pair), and Bob has one particle, ''B''. In the total system, the state of these three particles is given by

: <math>  |\Phi^+\rangle_{AB} \otimes |\psi\rangle_C =  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|0\rangle_A \otimes |0\rangle_B + |1\rangle_A \otimes |1\rangle_B)\otimes (\alpha |0\rangle_C + \beta|1\rangle_C).  </math>

Alice will then make a partial measurement in the Bell basis on the two qubits in her possession. To make the result of her measurement clear, we will rewrite the two qubits of Alice in the Bell basis via the following general identities (these can be easily verified):

:<math>|0\rangle \otimes |0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\Phi^+\rangle + |\Phi^-\rangle),</math>

:<math>|0\rangle \otimes |1\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\Psi^+\rangle + |\Psi^-\rangle),</math>

:<math>|1\rangle \otimes |0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\Psi^+\rangle - |\Psi^-\rangle),</math>

and

:<math>|1\rangle \otimes |1\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\Phi^+\rangle - |\Phi^-\rangle).</math>

The three particle state shown above thus becomes the following four-term superposition:

:<math>
\frac{1}{2} (\ |\Phi^+\rangle_{AC} \otimes (\alpha |0\rangle_B + \beta|1\rangle_B)\ +\ |\Phi^-\rangle_{AC} \otimes (\alpha |0\rangle_B - \beta|1\rangle_B)\ +\ |\Psi^+\rangle_{AC} \otimes (\beta |0\rangle_B + \alpha|1\rangle_B)\ +</math>
:<math>
\ + |\Psi^-\rangle_{AC} \otimes (\beta |0\rangle_B - \alpha|1\rangle_B)\ ).
</math>

Notice all we have done so far is a change of basis on Alice's part of the system. No operation has been performed and the three particles are still in the same state. The actual teleportation starts when Alice measures her two qubits in the Bell basis. Given the above expression, evidently the result of her (local) measurement is that the three-particle state would [[Wave_function_collapse|collapse]] to one of the following four states (with equal probability of obtaining each):

* <math>|\Phi^+\rangle_{AC} \otimes (\alpha |0\rangle_B + \beta|1\rangle_B)</math>
* <math>|\Phi^-\rangle_{AC} \otimes (\alpha |0\rangle_B - \beta|1\rangle_B)</math>
* <math>|\Psi^+\rangle_{AC} \otimes (\beta |0\rangle_B + \alpha|1\rangle_B)</math>
* <math>|\Psi^-\rangle_{AC} \otimes (\beta |0\rangle_B - \alpha|1\rangle_B)</math>

Alice's two particles are now entangled to each other, in one of the four [[Bell_states|Bell states]]. The entanglement originally shared between Alice's and Bob's is now broken. Bob's particle takes on one of the four superposition states shown above. Note how Bob's qubit is now in a state that resembles the state to be teleported. The four possible states for Bob's [[qubit|qubit]] are unitary images of the state to be teleported.

The crucial step, the local measurement done by Alice on the Bell basis, is done. It is clear how to proceed further. Alice now has complete knowledge of the state of the three particles; the result of her Bell measurement tells her which of the four states the system is in. She simply has to send her results to Bob through a classical channel. Two classical bits can communicate which of the four results she obtained.

After Bob receives the message from Alice, he will know which of the four states his particle is in. Using this information, he performs a unitary operation on his particle to transform it to the desired state <math>\alpha |0\rangle_B + \beta|1\rangle_B</math>:

* If Alice indicates her result is <math>|\Phi^+\rangle_{AC}</math>, Bob knows his qubit is already in the desired state and does nothing. This amounts to the trivial unitary operation, the identity operator.

* If the message indicates  <math>|\Phi^-\rangle_{AC}</math>, Bob would send his qubit through the unitary gate given by the [[Pauli_matrix|Pauli matrix]]

: <math>\sigma_3 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1\end{bmatrix}</math>

to recover the state.

*If Alice's message corresponds to <math>|\Psi^+\rangle_{AC}</math>, Bob applies the gate

:<math>\sigma_1 = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0\end{bmatrix}</math>

to his qubit.

*Finally, for the remaining case, the appropriate gate is given by

:<math> -\sigma_3 \sigma_1 = i \sigma_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -1 \\ 1 & 0\end{bmatrix}.</math>

Teleportation is therefore achieved.

Experimentally, the projective measurement done by Alice may be achieved via a series of laser pulses directed at the two particles.

=== Remarks ===

* After this operation, Bob's qubit will take on the state <math>|\psi\rangle_B= \alpha |0\rangle_B + \beta|1\rangle_B</math>, and Alice's qubit becomes (undefined) part of an entangled state. Teleportation does not result in the copying of qubits, and hence is consistent with the [[no_cloning_theorem|no cloning theorem]].
* There is no transfer of matter or energy involved. Alice's particle has not been physically moved to Bob; only its state has been transferred. The term "teleportation", coined by Bennett, Brassard, Crépeau, Jozsa, Peres and Wootters, reflects the indistinguishability of quantum mechanical particles.
* For every qubit teleported, Alice needs to send Bob two classical bits of information. These two classical bits do not carry complete information about the qubit being teleported. If an eavesdropper intercepts the two bits, she may know exactly what Bob needs to do in order to recover the desired state. However, this information is useless if she cannot interact with the entangled particle in Bob's possession.

=== Alternative description ===

In the literature, one might find alternative, but completely equivalent, descriptions of the teleportation protocol given above. Namely, the unitary transformation that is the change of basis (from the standard product basis into the Bell basis) can also be implemented by [[quantum_gate|quantum gate]]s. Direct calculation shows that this gate is given by

:<math>G = (H \otimes I) \; C_N</math>

where ''H'' is the one qubit [[Hadamard_gate|Walsh-Hadamard gate]] and <math>C_N</math> is the [[Controlled_NOT_gate|Controlled NOT gate]].

== Entanglement swapping ==

Teleportation can be applied not just to pure states, but also [[density_matrix|mixed states]], that can be regarded as the state of a single subsystem of an entangled pair. The so-called entanglement swapping is a simple and illustrative example.

If Alice has a particle which is entangled with a particle owned by Bob, and Bob teleports it to Carol, then afterwards, Alice's particle is entangled with Carol's.

A more symmetric way to describe the situation is the following: Alice has one particle, Bob two, and Carol one. Alice's particle and Bob's first particle are entangled, and so are Bob's second and Carol's particle:
                       ___
                      /   \
  Alice-:-:-:-:-:-Bob1 -:- Bob2-:-:-:-:-:-Carol
                      \___/

Now, if Bob performs a projective measurement on his two particles in the Bell state basis and communicates the results to Carol, as per the teleportation scheme described above, the state of Bob's first particle can be teleported to Carol's. Although Alice and Carol never interacted with each other, their particles are now entangled.

== N-state particles ==

One can imagine how the teleportation scheme given above might be extended to ''N''-state particles, i.e. particles whose states lie in the ''N'' dimensional Hilbert space. The combined system of the three particles now has a <math>N^3</math> dimensional state space. To teleport, Alice makes a partial measurement on the two particles in her possession in some entangled basis on the <math>N^2</math> dimensional subsystem. This measurement has <math>N^2</math> equally probable outcomes, which are then communicated to Bob classically. Bob recovers the desired state by sending his particle through an appropriate unitary gate.

== General teleportation scheme ==
=== General description ===

A general teleportation scheme can be described as follows. Three quantum systems are involved. System 1 is the (unknown) state ''ρ'' to be teleported by Alice. Systems 2 and 3 are in a maximally entangled state ''ω'' that are distributed to Alice and Bob, respectively. The total system is then in the state

: <math>\rho \otimes \omega.</math>

A successful teleportation process is a [[LOCC|LOCC]] [[quantum_channel|quantum channel]] Φ that satisfies

: <math>(\operatorname{Tr}_{12} \circ \Phi ) (\rho \otimes \omega) = \rho\,,</math>

where Tr<sub>12</sub> is the [[partial_trace|partial trace]] operation with respect systems 1 and 2, and <math>\circ</math> denotes the composition of maps. This describes the channel in the Schrödinger picture.

Taking adjoint maps in the Heisenberg picture, the success condition becomes

: <math>\langle \Phi(\rho \otimes \omega)| I \otimes O \rangle = \langle \rho | O \rangle</math>

for all observable ''O'' on Bob's system. The tensor factor in <math>I \otimes O</math> is <math>12 \otimes 3</math> while that of <math>\rho \otimes \omega</math> is <math>1 \otimes 23</math>.

=== Further details ===

The proposed channel Φ can be described more explicitly. To begin teleportation, Alice performs a local measurement on the two subsystems (1 and 2) in her possession. Assume the local measurement have ''effects''

: <math>{F_i} = {M_i ^2}.</math>

If the measurement registers the ''i''-th outcome, the overall state collapses to

: <math>(M_i \otimes I)(\rho \otimes \omega)(M_i \otimes I).</math>

The tensor factor in <math>(M_i \otimes I)</math> is <math>12 \otimes 3</math> while that of <math>\rho \otimes \omega</math> is <math>1 \otimes 23</math>. Bob then applies a corresponding local operation  Ψ''<sub>i</sub>'' on system 3. On the combined system, this is described by

: <math>(Id \otimes \Psi_i)(M_i \otimes I)(\rho \otimes \omega)(M_i \otimes I).</math>

where ''Id'' is the identity map on the composite system <math>1 \otimes 2</math>.

Therefore the channel Φ is defined by

: <math>\Phi (\rho \otimes \omega) = \sum_i (Id \otimes \Psi_i)(M_i \otimes I)(\rho \otimes \omega)(M_i \otimes I)</math>

Notice Φ satisfies the definition of [[LOCC|LOCC]]. As stated above, the teleportation is said to be successful if, for all observable ''O'' on Bob's system, the equality

: <math>\langle \Phi(\rho \otimes \omega), I \otimes O \rangle = \langle \rho, O \rangle</math>

holds. The left hand side of the equation is:

: <math>
\sum_i \langle (Id \otimes \Psi_i)(M_i \otimes I)(\rho \otimes \omega)(M_i \otimes I), \; I \otimes O \rangle
</math>

: <math>
= \sum_i \langle (M_i \otimes I)(\rho \otimes \omega)(M_i \otimes I), \; I \otimes \Psi_i ^*(O)\rangle 
</math>

where Ψ''<sub>i</sub>*'' is the adjoint of Ψ''<sub>i</sub>'' in the Heisenberg picture. Assuming all objects are finite dimensional, this becomes

: <math>\sum_i \operatorname{Tr} \; (\rho \otimes \omega)(F_i \otimes \Psi_i^*(O)).</math>

The success criterion for teleportation has the expression

: <math>\sum_i \operatorname{Tr} \; (\rho \otimes \omega)(F_i \otimes \Psi_i ^*(O)) = \operatorname{Tr} \; \rho \cdot O.</math>
