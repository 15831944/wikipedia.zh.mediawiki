'''偶然空缺'''({{lang|en|accidental gap}}、詞彙空缺<{{lang|en|lexical gap}}>、{{lang|en|gap}}、{{lang|en|lacuna}}、{{lang|en|hole in the pattern}})在[[語言學|語言學]]為一"單詞"或"其它詞句形式"在某種語言不存在，但是該語言的[[语法|语法]]規則能允許此種現象。<ref name=Crystal>{{Cite book |last=Crystal |first=David |title=A Dictionary of Linguistics and Phonetics |location=Malden |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |year=2003 |isbn=0-6312-2664-8}}</ref> 不過，它可以從其它語言直接引用"等值語言單位"、或另行創造"新詞或等值詞句形式"來替代原來之"單詞"或"詞句形式"的空缺。"偶然空缺"不同於"系統空缺"({{lang|en|systematic gap}})，即是偶然空缺是由於某些特定語言的音韻，形態，以及其它規則所設定的界限等之原因，因而使得在某些特定語言裡的一些詞彙或詞句形式不存在於另一種語言裡。

例如，普通話/國語中[[發音|發音]]為{{IPA|/pska51/}}的字是不存在的，因為它有複[[輔音|輔音]]，因而違背了其語音規則。這種情況屬於「系統空缺」。與此相反，{{IPA|/pou51/}}遵守其語音規則，但沒有漢字對應。雖然理論上這個字詞”在某些特定的語言裡”是可能存在的，可是實際上在普通話/國語裡卻不存在這樣一個語詞，所以它在普通話/國語的遺漏是屬於「偶然空缺」或「詞彙空缺」。

偶然空缺有多種形態。<!--Various types of accidental gaps exist. Phonological gaps are either words allowed by the [[phonology|phonological system]] of a language which do not actually exist, or sound contrasts missing from one [[pattern|paradigm]] of the phonological system itself. Morphological gaps are non-existent words predicted by the [[Morphology_(linguistics)|morphological system]]. A semantic gap refers to the non-existence of a word to describe a difference in [[Meaning_(linguistics)|meaning]] seen in other sets of words within the language.

”音韻空缺”(phonological gap)是不是話的，實際上並不存在一種語言的語音系統所允許，或反差的聲音從語音系統本身的一個範式缺失。”形態學空缺”(morphological gap)是由形態學系統預測的不存在的話。”語義空缺”(semantic gap)是指不存在一個詞來形容看到其他組詞的語言中的含義有差別的。

==音韻空缺==
Often words that are allowed in the phonological system of a language are absent. For example, in English the [[consonant_cluster|consonant cluster]] {{IPA|/bl/}} is allowed at the beginning of words such as ''blind'' or ''blister'' and the [[syllable_rime|syllable rime]] {{IPA|/ɪk/}} occurs in words such as ''sick'' or ''flicker''. Even so, there is no English word pronounced *{{IPA|/blɪk/}}. Although this potential word is phonologically [[Well-formedness|well-formed]], it happens to not exist.<ref name=Trask>{{Cite book |last=Trask |first=Robert Lawrence |title=A Dictionary of Phonetics and Phonology |location=London |publisher=Routledge |year=1996}}</ref>

The term "phonological gap" is also used to refer to the absence of a [[phonemic_contrast|phonemic contrast]] in part of the phonological system.<ref name=Crystal/> For example, [[Thai_language|Thai]] has several sets of [[stop_consonant|stop consonant]]s that differ in terms of [[Voice_(phonetics)|voicing]] (whether or not the [[vocal_cords|vocal cords]] vibrate) and [[Aspiration_(phonetics)|aspiration]] (whether a puff of air is released). Yet the language has no voiced [[velar_consonant|velar consonant]] ({{IPA|/ɡ/}}).<ref>{{Cite book |last=Abramson |first=Arthur S. |title=The Vowels and Tones of Standard Thai: Acoustical Measurements and Experiments |location=Bloomington |publisher=Indiana University Research Center in Anthropology, Folklore, and Linguistics |year=1962}}</ref> This lack of an expected distinction is commonly called a "hole in the pattern".<ref name=Trask/>

==Morphological gaps==
A morphological gap is the absence of a word that could exist given the morphological rules of a language, including its [[affix|affix]]es.<ref name=Crystal/> For example, in English a [[deverbal_noun|deverbal noun]] can be formed by adding either the suffix ''-al'' or ''-(t)ion'' to certain verbs (typically words from [[Latin_language|Latin]] through [[Anglo-Norman_French|Anglo-Norman French]] or [[Old_French|Old French]]). Some verbs, such as ''recite'' have two related nouns, ''recital'' and ''recitation''. However, in many cases there is only one such noun, as illustrated in the chart below. Although in principle the morphological rules of English allow for other nouns, those words do not exist.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Accidental gap |url=http://www2.let.uu.nl/UiL-OTS/Lexicon/zoek.pl?lemma=Accidental+gap&lemmacode=975 |work=Lexicon of Linguistics |editor=Kerstens, Johan, Eddy Ruys and Joost Zwarts |publisher=Utrecht institute of Linguistics OTS |year=2001 |accessdate=2011-02-12}}</ref>

A [[defective_verb|defective verb]] is a verb that lacks some [[grammatical_conjugation|grammatical conjugation]]. For example, several verbs in [[Russian_language|Russian]] do not have a [[Grammatical_person|first-person]] [[Grammatical_number|singular]] form in [[Present_tense|non-past tense]]. Although most verbs have such a form (e.g. ''vožu'' "I lead"), about 100 verbs in the [[Russian_grammar#Present-future_tense|second conjugation]] pattern (e.g. *''derz'u'' "I talk rudely"; the asterisk indicates [[Grammaticality|ungrammaticality]]) do not appear as first-person singular in the present-future tense.<ref name="Halle">{{Cite journal |last=Halle |first=Morris |year=1973 |title=Prolegomena to a theory of word-formation |journal=Linguistic Inquiry |volume=4 |pages=451–464}}</ref> Morris Halle called this defective verb paradigm an example of an accidental gap.

The similar case of [[unpaired_word|unpaired word]]s occurs where one word is obsolete or rare while another word [[Derivation_(linguistics)|derived]] from it is more common. Examples include *''effable'' and ''ineffable'' or *''kempt'' and ''unkempt''.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Quinion |first=Michael |title=Unpaired words |work=World Wide Words |url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/articles/unpaired.htm |date=23 November 1996 |accessdate=2012-07-31}}</ref>

==Semantic gaps==
In [[semantics|semantics]] a gap may be noted when a particular meaning distinction visible elsewhere in the [[lexicon|lexicon]] is absent. For example, English words describing family members generally show [[gender|gender]] distinction. Yet the English word ''cousin'' can refer to either a male or female cousin.<ref name=Crystal/>  Similarly, while there are general terms for siblings and parents, there is no comparable gender-neutral term for an aunt or uncle. The separate words predicted on the basis of this semantic contrast are absent from the language.
