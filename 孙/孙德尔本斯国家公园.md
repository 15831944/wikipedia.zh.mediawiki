On [[4_May|4 May]] [[1984|1984]] it was declared a National Park.  It was given a world heritage site in the year 1985. Whole Sundarbans area was declared as Biosphere Reserve in 1989.

The average altitude of the park is 7.5 m above sea level. The park is made up of 54 small islands and it crisscrossed by several tributaries of Ganga and Brahmaputra.
{{Wildlife WB}}
Sundarbans National Park is the largest estuarine mangrove forest in the world. Twenty-six of the fifty broad mangrove types found in the world grow well in the Sundarbans. The commonly identifiable vegetation that grow in the dense mangrove forests at the Sundarbans are salt water mixed forest, mangrove scrub, brackish water mixed forest, littoral forest, wet forest and wet alluvial grass forests. 

===氣候===
The average maximum and minimum temperature is 34 °C and 20 °C respectively. Rainfall is heavy with high humidity as high as 80% as it is close to the [[Bay_of_Bengal|Bay of Bengal]].

Storms which sometimes develop into cyclones are common during the month of May and October.

In the month of April and May the flaming red leaves of the Genwa  the crab-like red flowers of the Kankara and the yellow flowers of Khalsi can be seen, which add a beauty to the surroundings. Some of the more commonly found plants and trees in the park are Genwa, Dhundal, Passur, Garjan, Kankra, Sundari and Goran.

==Management and special projects==
The park has got protection since its creation. The core area is free from all human disturbances like collection of wood, honey, fishing and other forest produces. However in buffer area fishing, honey collection and wood cutting are permitted in limited form. Protection of the park from poaching and theft of forest products is done by well armed forest staffs who patrols in motorboats and launches. Moreover forest offices and camps are located at several important parts of the park. Anti-poaching camps are manned by 2 to 3 knowledgeable labourers under supervision of concerned beat guard/Forester/Range officer.

Habitat of wildlife is well maintained through eco-conservation, eco-development, training, education and research. 10 Forest Protection Committees and 14 Eco-development Committees have been formed in the fringe of Sundarbans Tiger Reserve helps in this regard. Seminars, workshops, awareness camps, etc. are organised frequently in the vicinity of park to educate the people on eco-conservation, eco-development and such other issues. Mangrove and other plants are planted in the fringe area to meet the local need of fuel wood for about 1000 villages and to conserve the buffer area. Conservation of soil is done to maintain the ecological balance. Several sweet water ponds have been dug up inside the park to provide drinking water to the wild animals.  
  
Controlling man-eating tigers is another major activity. The number of causalities has been reduced from 40 to 10 per year. The reduction in number of causalities is a result of   strict control over the movement of the people inside the tiger reserve, alternative income generation and awareness building among people. It is also believed that due to use of human masks and electric human dummies. Straying of tigers into nearby villages is prevented through effective measures like nylon net fencing, solar illumination of villages, etc. The youths of the villages are given training in controlling the straying of tigers into the villages.

The [[Mangrove_Interpretation_Centre|Mangrove Interpretation Centre]] is established at [[Sajnekhali|Sajnekhali]] to make the local people and tourists aware about importance of conservation of nature in general and specially the mangrove eco-systems.
 
===Constraints===   
Though there is tough protection in the park there are a few loopholes. The geographical topography with hostile terrain criss-crossed by several rivers and their tributaries, long international border with [[Bangladesh|Bangladesh]], fishing trawlers and launches helps in poaching, cutting of wood and also affecting the mangrove forests. Lack of staffs, infrastructure and lack of funds also added up the factors.    
 
==Park-specific information==
