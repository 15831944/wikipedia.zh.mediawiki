聲帶囊腫的症狀各不相同，但通常包括嘶啞的聲音及音調的問題。囊腫的初步治療涉及語音治療，以減少有傷害性的發聲行為。如果症狀仍然存在，患者可能需要手術去除囊腫。手術通常伴隨著聲帶的休息以及進一步的語音治療來恢復語音的功能。囊腫也可以使用聲帶[[類固醇|類固醇]]注射來治療。

== Causes ==
There are several causes of vocal fold cysts: 
# They can be [[Congenital_disorder|congenital]].<ref name=":0" />
# They can result from the blockage of a mucous gland's excretory duct.<ref name=":4" /> In this case, they are sometimes referred to as retention cysts.<ref name=":4">{{Cite journal|last=Reiter|first=Rudolf|last2=Hoffman|first2=Thomas Karl|last3=Pickhard|first3=Anja|last4=Brosche|first4=Sibylle|year=2015|title=Hoarseness - Causes and Treatment|journal=Deutsches Arzteblatt International|volume=112}}</ref>
# They can be the result of phonotrauma.<ref name=":0" /> Phonotrauma refers to behaviours that can lead to vocal fold injuries, such as vocal overuse (i.e. too much speaking), vocal misuse (i.e. speaking in an unnaturally high or low pitch), or vocal abuse (i.e. yelling or whispering for prolonged periods).<ref name=":5" /> Vocal folds vibrate during [[phonation|phonation]] resulting in repeated collisions of the right and left vocal folds.<ref name=":5" /> Phonotrauma subjects the vocal folds to excessive mechanical forces during these vibratory cycles, which can lead to the development of a wound.<ref name=":5" /> It is the healing of these wounds, which leads to tissue re-structuring, that can result in a vocal fold cyst.<ref name=":5">{{Cite journal|last=Johns|first=Michael M|year=2003|title=Update on the etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of vocal fold nodules, polyps, and cysts|journal=Current Opinion in Otolaryngology & Head and Neck Surgery|volume=11}}</ref>

== Signs and Symptoms ==
Both sub-epithelial vocal fold cysts and ligament vocal fold cysts involve similar symptoms.<ref name=":0" /> The presence and the severity of symptoms may be influenced by the location and size of the cyst.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last=Bohlender|first=Jörg|year=2013|title=Diagnostic and therapeutic pitfalls in benign vocal fold diseases|journal=GMS Current Topics in Otorhinolaryngology  Head and Neck Surgery|volume=12|page=}}</ref>  Common symptoms include:
* Hoarse voice
* Inability to produce high [[Pitch_(music)|pitch]] notes
* Fatigue when speaking
* Limited pitch range
* Pain near the [[larynx|larynx]]
* Variations in pitch when speaking<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" />
The accompanying signs and symptoms of vocal fold cysts may remain stable or increase over time.<ref name=":0" /> In rare cases, symptoms actually improve.<ref name=":0" /> Symptoms affecting the quality of the voice tend to worsen after speaking for long periods of time and when speaking with increased volume.<ref name=":0" /> Many individuals who use their voice professionally will find even the presence of slight symptoms to be problematic.<ref name=":0" /> However, some voice professionals are not impacted by the presence of vocal cysts.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last=Altman|first=Kenneth W.|title=Vocal Fold Masses|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0030666507001077|journal=Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America|volume=40|issue=5|pages=1091–1108|doi=10.1016/j.otc.2007.05.011}}</ref>

== Diagnosis ==
Mucous retention cysts are most commonly seen in individuals that endure high vocal stress in their daily lives, while epidermoid cysts are usually congenital or second to vocal trauma (see lead section for more information on different types of cysts).<ref name=":1" /> The two types of vocal fold cysts can be differentiated from other vocal fold growths in several ways. Both types show decreased amplitude of vibrations and reduced or absent mucosal wave.<ref name=":1" /> Mucous retention cysts show a translucent mass of mucous usually below the free margin of the glottis, while epidermoid cysts are yellow masses under the first epithelial layer of the vocal folds.<ref name=":5" /> Epidermoid cysts generally appear in the superior and medial regions of the midmusculomembranous region of the folds, as opposed to mucous cysts appearing in the inferior region.<ref name=":22">{{Cite journal|last=Franco|first=Ramon A.|last2=Andrus|first2=Jennifer G.|title=Common Diagnoses and Treatments in Professional Voice Users|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0030666507001041|journal=Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America|volume=40|issue=5|pages=1025–1061|doi=10.1016/j.otc.2007.05.008}}</ref> Vocal fold cysts are differentiated from other vocal fold masses in that they are unilateral and subepithelial.<ref name=":22" />

Four components to a full diagnosis are: medical and voice history, head and neck exam, then perceptual assessment of voice and imaging of vocal folds.<ref name=":5" /> The primary perceptual sign of vocal fold cysts is hoarseness of the voice.<ref name=":22" /> However, diagnosis is difficult; in most cases, when a diagnosis cannot first be reached via behavioural assessment and intervention, the patient undergoes an imaging procedure.<ref name=":3" /> Imaging is most commonly done with laryngeal videostroboscopy.<ref name=":5" /> This procedure provides information about vocal fold vibrations during speech, vocal intensity and vocal frequency.<ref name=":5" /> Imaging shows the reduced movement of the vocal folds (mucosal wave) when a vocal fold cyst is present.<ref name=":5" />

Patients with vocal fold cysts are considered for surgery when presenting with:<ref name=":3" />
* [[Dysphonia|Dysphonia]]
* Lack of improvement through voice therapy

== Treatment ==
Vocal fold cysts are treated using a multidisciplinary approach.<ref name="Practical Laryngology">{{cite book|title=Practical Laryngology|last=|first=|date=2016|publisher=CRC Press, Taylor & Francis Group|year=|isbn=978-1-4441-8367-2|editor-last=Costello|editor-first=Declan|edition=|location=Boca Raton, FL|publication-place=|pages=|editor-last2=Sandhu|editor-first2=Guri|via=|accessdate=28 September 2016}}</ref><ref name="ENT Board Prep">{{cite book|title=ENT Board Prep: High Yield Review for the Otolaryngology In-service and Board Exams|date=2014|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4614-8354-0|location=New York, NY|editor1-last=Lin|editor1-first=Fred Y.|editor2-last=Patel|editor2-first=Zara M.|accessdate=28 September 2016}}</ref> Voice therapy to address harmful vocal behaviours is recommended as the first treatment option.<ref name=":22" /> Voice therapy may involve reducing tension in the larynx, reducing loudness, reducing the amount of speech produced, and modifying the environment.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&lr=&id=1RwVcsw0KLAC&oi=fnd&pg=PR1&dq=cyst+AND+vocal+AND+diagnosis&ots=eU5BTyI6MM&sig=GLA5UXxHMuEg0qE2tkJaAX-uOFU#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Understanding Voice Problems: A Physiological Perspective for Diagnosis and Treatment|last=Colton|first=Raymond H.|last2=Casper|first2=Janina K.|last3=Leonard|first3=Rebecca|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|year=2006|isbn=9780781742399|location=Baltimore|pages=|language=|quote=|via=}}</ref> If symptoms are significant, treatment usually involves [[microsurgery|microsurgery]] to remove the cyst.<ref name=":22" />

During surgery, attempts are made to preserve as much vocal fold tissue as possible,<ref name=":22" /> given that glottal insufficiency (a gap in the vocal folds) is a possible consequence of surgery.<ref name="Practical Laryngology" /> Vocal fold tissue can be preserved during surgery by raising a microflap, removing the cyst, then laying the flap back down.<ref name="Practical Laryngology" /> This is intended to lead to minimal scarring and improved voice function.<ref name="Practical Laryngology" /> However, if any epithelium from the cyst sac is left behind during surgery, the cyst may regrow.<ref name=":2" /> Surgery of the larynx may also be conducted using a [[Carbon_dioxide_laser|CO<sub>2</sub> laser]], which was reported as early as the 1970s.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Benninger|first=Michael S.|date=2000|title=Microdissection or Microspot CO2 Laser for Limited Vocal Fold Benign Lesions: A Prospective Randomized Trial|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1097/00005537-200002001-00001/abstract|journal=The Laryngoscope|language=|volume=110|issue=S92|pages=|doi=10.1097/00005537-200002001-00001|issn=1531-4995}}</ref> Congenital ductal cysts (those caused by blockage of a glandular duct) may be treated by [[marsupialization|marsupialization]].<ref name="Congenital Anomalies">{{cite journal|last2=Soliman|first2=Ahmed M.S.|date=February 2007|title=Congenital Anomalies of the Larynx|journal=Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America|volume=40|issue=1|pages=177–191|doi=10.1016/j.otc.2006.10.004|last1=Ahmad|first1=Sidrah M.|accessdate=28 September 2016}}</ref>

Following surgery, patients are recommended to take 2 to 14 days of [[vocal_rest|vocal rest]].<ref name=":3" /> In absolute vocal rest, activities such as talking, whispering, whistling, straining, coughing, and sneezing are restricted.<ref name=":24">{{Cite book|title=Operative Otolaryngology: Head and Neck Surgery, Second Edition|last=Myers|first=Eugene N.|publisher=Saunders|year=2008|isbn=978-1-4160-2445-3|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref> Once adequate healing has occurred, the patient may be transitioned to relative vocal rest, which typically involves 5 to 10 minutes of breathy voicing per hour.<ref name=":24" /> Voice therapy is then required to restore as much function as possible.<ref name=":22" /> Post-operative voice therapy may include addressing harmful vocal behaviours, exercises to restrengthen the larynx, and reintegration into normal voice activities.<ref name=":14">{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbivar.com/pdf/postsurgical_vocal_rest.pdf|title=Postsurgical Vocal Rest Recommendations|last=Ballif|first=Catherine L.|last2=Gorman|first2=Stephen|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=November 6, 2016|last3=Kelchner|first3=Lisa N.|last4=LeBorgne|first4=Wendy D.|last5=Rettig|first5=Jennifer R.}}</ref>

Professional voice users who do not experience substantial limitations due to their cysts may choose to forego surgery.<ref name=":2" /> Considering that some cysts remain stable over long periods of time, voice therapy alone may be an option for those who are resistant to surgery.<ref name="Practical Laryngology" /> Another option for those who are unwilling to undergo surgery is vocal fold steroid injection (VFSI).<ref name=":32">{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Chi-Te|last2=Liao|first2=Li-Jen|last3=Cheng|first3=Po-Wen|last4=Lo|first4=Wu-Chia|last5=Lai|first5=Mei-Shu|date=2013|title=Intralesional steroid injection for benign vocal fold disorders: A systematic review and meta-analysis|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lary.23551/abstract|journal=The Laryngoscope|language=|volume=123|issue=1|pages=197–203|doi=10.1002/lary.23551|issn=1531-4995}}</ref> Injection of the vocal folds may be done transorally or [[percutaneous|percutaneous]]ly, through the [[thyrohyoid_membrane|thyrohyoid membrane]], [[thyroid_cartilage|thyroid cartilage]], or [[cricothyroid_membrane|cricothyroid membrane]].<ref name=":32" /> After VFSI, patients are recommended to take 1 to 7 days of vocal rest.<ref name=":32" /> VFSI may also be used to delay surgery, or as a treatment method when the risks associated with surgery are deemed to be too high.<ref name=":32" />

== Prognosis ==
Following diagnosis, voice therapy should be implemented to optimize vocal hygiene.<ref name=":22" /> However, vocal fold cysts typically do not improve with solely vocal rest or vocal therapy. Instead, a surgical procedure utilizing the microflap approach is conducted to remove the cyst (see Treatment).

Following surgery, patients are advised to rest their voice for one week with gradual re-introduction of voice use with a Speech-Language Pathologist after this period of rest.<ref name=":3" /> This initial rest period can vary between 2 and 14 days.<ref name=":3" /> Patients with subepithelial cysts have a better prognosis for timely recovery of vocal abilities than patients with ligament vocal fold cysts.<ref name=":3" /> Typically, patients can resume speaking activities in 7–30 days following surgery, and singing activities 30–90 days post-surgery.<ref name=":3" />

Up to 20% of patients show scarring, polyps or vascular changes of the vocal folds following surgery.<ref name=":1" /> In severe cases, these resulting symptoms may require further surgery. The patient must always be aware of the impact and potential complications of surgery on their voice, especially if the voice is heavily used occupationally. In these cases, post-operative therapy should be discussed.

== Prevention ==
A key aspect of preventing vocal fold cysts is good vocal hygiene.<ref name=":6">{{Cite book|title=Expert guide to otolaryngology|last=|first=|publisher=American College of Physicians|year=2001|isbn=|editor-last=Calhoun|editor-first=Karen H.|edition=1st|location=|pages=|editor-last2=Wax|editor-first2=Mark K.|editor-last3=Ebling|editor-first3=David E.|via=}}</ref> Good vocal hygiene promotes the healthy use of the vocal apparatus and the avoidance of phonotrauma.<ref name=":6" /> Good vocal hygiene practices involve the avoidance of:<ref name=":6" />
* Shouting
* Whispering loudly or for long periods of time
* Large quantities of talking over loud background noise
* Talking while yawning
* Continual clearing of the throat
* Speaking in an unnatural voice (i.e. too high or low)
* Talking with a cold or [[laryngitis|laryngitis]]
* Smoking [[tobacco|tobacco]] or [[Cannabis_(drug)|marijuana]]
* The consumption of [[Alcoholic_drink|alcohol]] and [[coffee|coffee]]
* The use of [[antihistamine|antihistamine]]s, [[aspirin|aspirin]], [[steroid|steroid]]s, [[tricyclic_antidepressant|tricyclic antidepressant]]s, or any substance that alters perception (i.e. sleeping pills)
* Foul air<ref name=":6" />
In addition, good vocal hygiene involves getting enough rest and drinking lots of water.<ref name=":6" /> It is important to keep the vocal fold tissue healthy and hydrated, and when possible to limit the quantity of speaking in order to avoid damage.<ref name=":6" />
