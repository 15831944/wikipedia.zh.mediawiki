[[File:Angioedema2013.JPG|thumb]]
[[File:Blausen_0023_Angioedema.png|thumb]]

The skin of the face, normally around the mouth, and the mucosa of the mouth and/or throat, as well as the [[tongue|tongue]], swell over the period of minutes to hours. The swelling can also occur elsewhere, typically in the hands.  The swelling can be [[itch|itch]]y or painful.  There may also be slightly decreased sensation in the affected areas due to compression of the nerves. [[Urticaria|Urticaria]] (hives) may develop simultaneously.

In severe cases, [[stridor|stridor]] of the airway occurs, with gasping or wheezy inspiratory breath sounds and decreasing [[oxygen|oxygen]] levels. [[Tracheal_intubation|Tracheal intubation]] is required in these situations to prevent [[respiratory_arrest|respiratory arrest]] and risk of death.

Sometimes, the cause is recent exposure to an [[allergen|allergen]] (e.g. [[peanut|peanut]]s), but more often it is either [[idiopathic|idiopathic]] (unknown) or only weakly correlated to allergen exposure.

In hereditary angioedema, often no direct cause is identifiable, although mild [[Physical_trauma|trauma]], including dental work and other stimuli, can cause attacks.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Bork K |author2=Barnstedt Se |title=Laryngeal edema and death from asphyxiation after tooth extraction in four patients with hereditary angioedema |journal=J Am Dent Assoc |volume=134 |issue=8 |pages=1088–94 |date=August 2003 |pmid=12956349 |doi=10.14219/jada.archive.2003.0323 |url=http://jada.ada.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12956349 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120723161200/http://jada.ada.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12956349 |archivedate=2012-07-23 }}</ref> There is usually no associated itch or urticaria, as it is not an allergic response.  Patients with HAE can also have recurrent episodes (often called "attacks") of [[abdominal_pain|abdominal pain]], usually accompanied by intense vomiting, weakness, and in some cases, watery diarrhea, and an unraised, nonitchy splotchy/swirly rash.  These stomach attacks can last one to five days on average, and can require hospitalization for aggressive pain management and hydration. Abdominal attacks have also been known to cause a significant increase in the patient's white blood cell count, usually in the vicinity of 13,000 to 30,000.  As the symptoms begin to diminish, the white count slowly begins to decrease, returning to normal when the attack subsides. As the symptoms and diagnostic tests are almost indistinguishable from an [[acute_abdomen|acute abdomen]] (e.g. perforated [[appendicitis|appendicitis]]) it is possible for undiagnosed HAE patients to undergo [[laparotomy|laparotomy]] (operations on the abdomen) or [[laparoscopy|laparoscopy]] (keyhole surgery) that turns out to have been unnecessary.

HAE may also cause swelling in a variety of other locations, most commonly the limbs, genitals, neck, throat and face. The pain associated with these swellings varies from mildly uncomfortable to agonizing pain, depending on its location and severity. Predicting where and when the next episode of edema will occur is impossible. Most patients have an average of one episode per month, but there are also patients who have weekly episodes or only one or two episodes per year. The triggers can vary and include infections, minor injuries, mechanical irritation, operations or stress. In most cases, edema develops over a period of 12–36 hours and then subsides within 2–5 days.

==诊断==
The diagnosis is made on the clinical picture. Routine blood tests ([[complete_blood_count|complete blood count]], [[electrolyte|electrolyte]]s, [[renal_function|renal function]], [[liver_enzyme|liver enzyme]]s) are typically performed. [[Tryptase|Mast cell tryptase]] levels may be elevated if the attack was due to an acute allergic (anaphylactic) reaction. When the patient has been stabilized, particular investigations may clarify the exact cause; [[complement_system|complement]] levels, especially depletion of complement factors 2 and 4, may indicate deficiency of ''[[C1-inhibitor|C1-inhibitor]]''. HAE type III is a diagnosis of exclusion consisting of observed angioedema along with normal C1 levels and function.

The hereditary form (HAE) often goes undetected for a long time, as its symptoms resemble those of more common disorders, such as allergy or intestinal colic. An important clue is the failure of hereditary angioedema to respond to [[antihistamines|antihistamines]] or [[glucocorticoid|steroids]], a characteristic that distinguishes it from allergic reactions. It is particularly difficult to diagnose HAE in patients whose episodes are confined to the gastrointestinal tract. Besides a family history of the disease, only a laboratory analysis can provide final confirmation. In this analysis, it is usually a reduced complement factor C4, rather than the C1-INH deficiency itself, that is detected. The former is used during the reaction cascade in the complement system of immune defense, which is permanently overactive due to the lack of regulation by C1-INH.

Angioedema is classified as either hereditary or acquired.

It can also occur as a side effect to certain medications, particularly [[ACE_inhibitor|ACE inhibitor]]s.

Edema of the gastrointestinal mucosa typically leads to severe abdominal pain; in the upper respiratory tract, it can be life-threatening.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Moon, MD|first1=Amanda T.|last2=Heymann, MD|first2=Warren R.|title=Acquired Angioedema|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1048887-overview|website=MedScape|accessdate=1 October 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905111954/http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1048887-overview|archivedate=5 September 2015|df=}}</ref>

===遗传型血管性水肿===
[[Hereditary_angioedema|Hereditary angioedema]] (HAE) exists in three forms, all of which are caused by a genetic mutation inherited in an [[Dominance_(genetics)|autosomal dominant]] form. They are distinguished by the underlying genetic abnormality. Types I and II are caused by mutations in the ''SERPING1'' gene, which result in either diminished levels of the [[C1-inhibitor|C1-inhibitor]] protein (type I HAE) or dysfunctional forms of the same protein (type II HAE). Type III HAE has been linked with mutations in the ''F12'' gene, which encodes the coagulation protein [[factor_XII|factor XII]]. All forms of HAE lead to abnormal activation of the [[complement_system|complement system]], and all forms can cause swelling elsewhere in the body, such as the [[digestive_tract|digestive tract]]. If HAE involves the [[larynx|larynx]], it can cause life-threatening [[asphyxiation|asphyxiation]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zuraw B.L. |title=Clinical practice. Hereditary angioedema |journal=N.

The end product of this cascade, bradykinin, is produced in large amounts and is believed to be the predominant mediator leading to increased vascular permeability and vasodilation that induces typical angioedema "attacks".<ref>{{cite web|last=Loew|first=Burr|title=A 68-Year-Old Woman With Recurrent Abdominal Pain, Nausea, and Vomiting|url=http://www.medscape.org/viewarticle/743937_2|publisher=MedScape|accessdate=19 October 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022004946/http://www.medscape.org/viewarticle/743937_2|archivedate=22 October 2012|df=}}</ref>

==治疗==

=== 过敏 ===
In allergic angioedema, avoidance of the allergen and use of antihistamines may prevent future attacks. [[Cetirizine|Cetirizine]] is a commonly prescribed antihistamine for angioedema.  Some patients have reported success with the combination of a nightly low dose of cetirizine to moderate the frequency and severity of attacks, followed by a much higher dose when an attack does appear.  Severe angioedema cases may require desensitization to the putative allergen, as mortality can occur. Chronic cases require [[glucocorticoid|steroid]] therapy, which generally leads to a good response. In cases where allergic attack is progressing towards airway obstruction, [[epinephrine|epinephrine]] may be life-saving.

In [[hereditary_angioedema|hereditary angioedema]], specific stimuli that have previously led to attacks may need to be avoided in the future. It does not respond to antihistamines, corticosteroids, or epinephrine. Acute treatment consists of C1-INH (C1-esterase inhibitor) concentrate from donor blood, which must be administered intravenously. In an emergency, fresh frozen blood plasma, which also contains C1-INH, can also be used. However, in most European countries, C1-INH concentrate is only available to patients who are participating in special programmes.{{citation needed | date=May 2017}} The medications [[ecallantide|ecallantide]] and [[icatibant|icatibant]] may be used to treat attacks.<ref name=Bern2017/> In 2017 these medications cost between 5,700 and 14,000 {{USD}} per dose in the United States, prices that tripled in two years.<ref>{{cite web|last1=LLC|first1=Prime Therapeutics|title=Study: Drug Costs for Rare Hereditary Angioedema Disorder Tripled in Two Years|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/study-drug-costs-for-rare-hereditary-angioedema-disorder-tripled-in-two-years-300061264.html|website=www.prnewswire.com|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151025113056/http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/study-drug-costs-for-rare-hereditary-angioedema-disorder-tripled-in-two-years-300061264.html|archivedate=2015-10-25|df=}}</ref>{{Medical citation needed|date=May 2017}}
