在[[語言學|語言學]]中，'''主事'''（{{lang|en|agent}}）是事件的原因或引發的動機。<ref>{{cite book|last=Kroeger|first=Paul|title=Analyzing Grammar: An Introduction|year=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-01653-7|pages=54}}</ref>主事也可以是「[[主題關係|主題角色]]」（也稱為「主題關係」）的名稱。這個詞語來自[[拉丁語|拉丁語]]動詞''agere''的[[現在分詞|現在分詞]]''agens''，為「做」（to do）或「使得」（to make），而''agentis''為「一個人做」。

==理論==
這種情況通常被標註為一個[[句子|句子]]，用在表示句中動詞的動作，及[[名詞短語|名詞短語]](noun phrase/np)的主事者。

例如，在一個句子"{{lang|en|Jack kicked the ball}}"(傑克踢球)，"Jack"(傑克)是主事而"ball"(球)是[[受事_(語法)|受事]](Patient (grammar))。在某些語言中，主事會[[变格|变格]]或以其他方式標明其語法作用。在[[日語|日語]]中，例如，在主事以格分詞"ga"({{lang|ja|が}})來標記。然而"主格"(nominative case)也被稱為"裸格"(bare case)或"hadaka-kaku"({{lang|ja|ハダカ格}}，即沒標註有任何的"格分詞"(case particle)。<ref name=tarou_takahashi>{{cite book|last=Takahashi|first=Tarou, et al.|title=A Japanese Grammar 4th Edition|year=2010|publisher=Hitsuji Shobou|location=Japan|isbn=978-4-89476-244-2|page=27}}</ref> 雖然[[英語|現代英語]]沒有標註主事的語法作用，主事是以非正式的表示法使用在特定的約定上；比如，與[[語素|語素]]一起使用的[[後綴|後綴]]語"-ing"、"-er"，或"-or"，使用在"eating"(吃)、"user"，或"prosecutor"(檢察官)。(比照"[[主事名詞|主事名詞]]"(agent noun)一項）

The notion of [[Agency_(philosophy)|agency]] is easy to grasp intuitively but notoriously difficult to define: typical qualities that a grammatical agent often has are that it has [[volition_(linguistics)|volition]], is sentient or perceives, causes a change of state, or moves. The linguist [[David_Dowty|David Dowty]] included these qualities in his definition of a Proto-Agent, and proposed that the nominal with the most elements of the Proto-Agent and the fewest elements of the Proto-Patient tends to be treated as the agent in a sentence.<ref>Dowty, David. 1991. "Thematic proto-roles and argument selection", ''Language'', 67.3:547-619</ref> This solves problems that most semanticists have with deciding on the number and quality of thematic roles. For example, in the sentence ''His energy surprised everyone'', ''His energy'' is the agent, even though it does not have most of the typical agent-like qualities such as perception, movement, or volition. Even Dowty's solution fails for verbs expressing relationships in time:

(1) April precedes May.     vs:      (2) May follows April.

Here what is agent and what is patient must be specified for each individual verb.

The grammatical agent is often confused with the [[subject_(grammar)|subject]], but these two notions are quite distinct: the former is based explicitly on its relationship to the action or event expressed by the [[verb|verb]], whereas the latter is based on the [[information_flow|flow of information]], word order, and importance to the sentence. In a sentence such as "The boy kicked the ball", "the boy" is the agent ''and'' the subject. However, when the sentence is rendered in the [[passive_voice|passive voice]], "The ball was kicked by the boy", "the ball" is the grammatical subject, but "the boy" is still the agent. Many sentences in English and other [[Indo-European_languages|Indo-European languages]] have the agent as subject.

The use of some [[transitive_verbs|transitive verbs]] denoting strictly reciprocal events may involve a conflation of agent and subject. In the sentence "John met Sylvia", for example, though both "John" and "Sylvia" would equally meet Dowty's definition of a Proto-Agent, the co-agent "Sylvia" is downgraded to patient because it is the direct object of the sentence.<ref>Givóm, Tom. 2001.
