'''约翰一世·阿尔布雷赫特'''（{{lang|pl|'''Jan I Olbracht (Albrecht)'''}}，{{bd|1459年|12月27日|1501年|6月17日|}}）是[[波兰国王|波兰国王]]（1492年－1501年在位）和[[格沃古夫|格沃古夫]][[公爵|公爵]]（1491年－1498年在位）。他繼承前任，持續著[[波蘭-鄂圖曼戰爭|對土耳其的戰爭]]，卻在1497年戰敗收場。

== Life==

John was the third son of [[Casimir_IV_Jagiellon|Casimir IV Jagiellon]], King of Poland, and [[Elisabeth_of_Austria_(d._1505)|Elisabeth of Austria]], daughter of [[Albert_II_of_Germany|Albert II of Germany]]. As crown prince, he distinguished himself by his brilliant victory over the [[Tatars|Tatars]] at [[Kopersztyn|Kopersztyn]] (1487). In 1490, the [[Kingdom_of_Hungary|Hungarian]] nobility proclaimed John [[King_of_Hungary|King of Hungary]] at the [[Rákos|Rákos]] diet. He was, however, defeated by his brother, King [[Ladislaus_II_of_Bohemia_and_Hungary|Ladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary]]. In 1492, John succeeded his father as King of Poland.

Losses of revenue due to the secession of [[Grand_Duchy_of_Lithuania|Lithuania]] placed John at the mercy of the Polish ''[[sejmik|sejmik]]''s, or local diets, where the ''[[szlachta|szlachta]]'', or local nobles, made their subsidies dependent on the king's subservience.

John desired to pose as the champion of [[Christendom|Christendom]] against the [[Ottoman_Turks|Ottoman Turks]]. Circumstances seemed, moreover, to favor him. In his brother Ladislaus, who as King of Hungary and Bohemia possessed a dominant influence in central Europe, he found a counterpoise to the machinations of Emperor [[Maximilian_I,_Holy_Roman_Emperor|Maximilian I]], who in 1492 had concluded an alliance against him with [[Ivan_III_of_Russia|Ivan III]] of [[Muscovy|Muscovy]]. As [[suzerain|suzerain]] of [[Moldavia|Moldavia]], John was favorably situated for attacking the Turks. At the conference of [[Leutschau|Leutschau]] (1494), the details of the expedition were arranged between the kings of Poland and Hungary and Elector [[John_Cicero,_Elector_of_Brandenburg|John Cicero of Brandenburg]], with the co-operation of [[Stephen_III_of_Moldavia|Stephen III of Moldavia]], ''[[hospodar|hospodar]]'' of Moldavia, who had appealed to John for assistance.

In the course of 1496 John collected an army of 80,000 men in Poland with great difficulty, but the crusade was deflected from its course by the sudden invasion of [[Galicia_(Central_Europe)|Galicia]]{{Fact|date=March 2009}} by the ''hospodar'', who apparently — for the whole subject is still very obscure — had been misled{{Fact|date=August 2007}} by reports from Hungary that John was bent upon placing his younger brother [[Sigismund_I_the_Old|Sigismund]] on the throne of Moldavia. Whatever the reason, the Poles entered Moldavia not as friends but as foes, and after the abortive siege of [[Suceava|Suceava]] were compelled to retreat following defeat at the [[Battle_of_the_Cosmin_Forest|Battle of the Cosmin Forest]]. The insubordination of the ''szlachta'' seems to have been one cause of this disgraceful collapse, for John after his return confiscated hundreds of their estates; in spite of which, to the end of his life he retained his extraordinary popularity. 

When the new [[Grand_Master_of_the_Teutonic_Knights|Grand Master]] of the [[Teutonic_Knights|Teutonic Knights]], [[Friedrich_Wettin_von_Sachsen|Friedrich Wettin von Sachsen]], refused to render homage to the Polish crown, John compelled him to do so. His intention to still further humiliate the Teutonic Order was stymied by his sudden death in 1501.
