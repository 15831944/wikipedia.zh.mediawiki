== 移民與人口成長率 ==
<!--South East Queensland is the fastest growing region in Australia, fuelled principally by migration from the southern states. {{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} The region has experienced significant population growth over the last two decades, growing on average by 55,000 to 80,000 people a year since 1986. {{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} This growth equates to 1,000 new arrivals in the region every week. {{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} South East Queensland is expected to be home to four million by 2026.<ref name=autogenerated2 />

== 區域發展計劃 ==
<!--
South East Queensland's future development will be heavily based on the South East Queensland Regional Plan, released by the Queensland state government in 2005<ref name=autogenerated1>http://www.oum.qld.gov.au/?id=241 South East Queensland Regional Plan</ref>. The regional plan covers the period from 2009 - 2031 and focuses on slowing development along the coast, in order to prevent creating a [[The_Brisbane_Institute#The_200_Kilometre_City|200 km city]], and instead aim for growth in the west, in particular around [[Springfield,_Queensland|Springfield]] and [[Beaudesert,_Queensland|Beaudesert]]<ref name=autogenerated1 />.
