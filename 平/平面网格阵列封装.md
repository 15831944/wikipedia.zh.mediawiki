'''平面網格陣列封裝'''（{{lang-en|'''LGA''', Land grid array}}）是一種[[積體電路|積體電路]]的[[表面安装技术|表面安装技术]]。其特點在於其[[針腳|針腳]]是位於[[CPU插座|插座]]上而非積體電路上。LGA封裝的晶片能被連接到[[印刷電路板|印刷電路板]]（'''PCB'''）上或直接[[焊接|焊接]]至電路板上。與傳統針腳在積體電路上的封裝方式相比，可減少針腳損壞的問題並可增加腳位。

==描述==
{{TransH}}
The ''land grid array'' is a packaging technology with a square grid of contacts on the underside of a package. The contacts are to be connected to a grid of contacts on the PCB. Not all rows and columns of the grid need to be used. The contacts can either be made by using an LGA socket, or by using solder paste.

LGA packaging is related to [[ball_grid_array|ball grid array]] (BGA) and [[pin_grid_array|pin grid array]] (PGA) packaging. Unlike pin grid arrays, land grid array packages are designed to fit both in a socket or be soldered down using surface mount technology. PGA packages cannot be soldered down using surface mount technology. In contrast with a BGA, land grid array packages in non socketed configurations have no balls and use a flat contact which is soldered directly to the PCB and BGA packages have balls as their contacts in between the IC and the PCBs.

==在微處理器中的應用==
LGA is used as a physical interface for microprocessors of the [[Intel|Intel]] [[Pentium_4|Pentium 4]] (Prescott), Intel [[Xeon|Xeon]], [[Intel_Core_2|Intel Core 2]], [[Intel_Core|Intel Core]] ([[Bloomfield_(microprocessor)|Bloomfield]] and [[Lynnfield_(microprocessor)|Lynnfield]]) and [[AMD|AMD]] [[Opteron|Opteron]] families.  Unlike the [[pin_grid_array|pin grid array]] (PGA) interface found on most [[AMD|AMD]] and older [[Intel|Intel]] processors, there are no pins on the chip; in place of the pins are pads of bare gold-plated copper that touch protruding pins on the microprocessor's placeholder on the [[motherboard|motherboard]].

While LGA sockets have been in use as early as 1996 by the [[MIPS_architecture|MIPS]] [[R10000|R10000]] and [[HP|HP]] [[PA-8000|PA-8000]] processors, the interface did not gain widespread use until Intel introduced their LGA platform, starting with the 5x0 and 6x0 sequence [[Pentium_4#Prescott|Pentium 4 (Prescott)]] in 2004. All [[Pentium_D|Pentium D]] and [[Intel_Core_2|Core 2]] desktop processors currently use an LGA socket. As of Q1 2006, Intel switched the Xeon server platform to LGA, starting with the 5000-series models. [[AMD|AMD]] introduced their server LGA platform starting with the 2000-series [[Opteron|Opteron]] in Q2 2006. AMD offered the Athlon 64 FX series on socket 1207FX through ASUS's L1N64-SLI WS motherboards.  It was the only desktop LGA solution offered by AMD.

The most common Intel desktop LGA socket is dubbed [[LGA_1155|LGA 1155]] (Socket H2), which is used with Intel's [[Sandy_Bridge_(microarchitecture)|Sandy Bridge]] and [[Ivy_Bridge_(microarchitecture)|Ivy Bridge]] series Core i3, i5, and i7 families. However, the [[Sandy_Bridge-E|Sandy Bridge-E]] Core i7 family uses the [[LGA_2011|LGA 2011]] (Socket R) socket. The LGA setup provides higher pin densities, allowing more power contacts and thus a more stable power supply to the chip. LGA packaging also has a tertiary benefit of placing pins onto the motherboard; if a pin breaks, the motherboard is often cheaper to replace than the CPU chip (as compared to a PGA chip/socket setup).

The AMD server LGA socket is designated [[Socket_G34|Socket G34]] (LGA 1944). Like Intel, AMD decided to use LGA sockets for their higher pin densities, as a 1944-pin PGA would simply be too large for most motherboards.
