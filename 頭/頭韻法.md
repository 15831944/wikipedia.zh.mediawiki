'''頭韻法'''（Alliteration）是西方詩歌裡的一種押韻形式，它是說一行韻文或一首詩的好幾個詞的頭一個字母輔音不斷重複，這樣形成了一個韻律。像一個有名的英語繞口令（頭韻是字母p）：
<blockquote>
Peter Piper picked a pek of pickled peppers,
A peck of pickled peppers Peter Piper picked.
If Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers,
How many pickled peppers did Peter Piper pick?

But if Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers,
Were they pickled when he picked them from the vine?
Or was Peter Piper pickled when he picked the pickled peppers
Peppers picked from the pickled pepper vine?
</blockquote>
