<!--From [[1945|1945]] to [[1949|1949]], he studied architecture at [[ETH_Zurich|ETH Zurich]], graduating in [[1956|1956]] with his Ph.D. In [[1955|1955]] he started his own architecture office in Zurich. [[1974|1974]] Justus Dahinden became Professor of Architecture at [[Vienna_University_of_Technology|TU Wien]] School of Architecture, [[Vienna_University_of_Technology|Vienna University of Technology]]. He was Director of the Institute of Space and Interior Design in [[Vienna|Vienna]], from 1974 to 1995. He was appointed Life Professor at the International Academy of Architects (IAA) of [[Sofia|Sofia]] in [[1988|1988]], helping establish its reputation as one of the leading architecture schools.

Justus Dahinden exerting an influence on the broad field of architecture with ideas which have resulted in numerous suggestions and impulses. The centre of Dahinden's phliosophy of the holistic nature of architecture is that it is a service to the human being. It is equally important to man as a physical and as a mental reality. In architecture the rational fulfilling of needs has to be complemented by taking into consideration the emotional world of the human being, whose state of mind and behavior are fundamentally influenced by architectural design. To Justus Dahinden architecture as a language is of equal importance to architecture as a function. From this he has developed a very individual theory about contextualism in architecture. 

Dahinden has seen architecture as creation and evolution in the "law of the three" ("Das Gesetz der Drei"), and in doing so he provides a basis for regaining quality in architecture. His architectural architecure for non-integrated leisure time is contrasted with handlinh architcture for integrated leisure time. This contrast results in town-planning utopias.

Justus Dahinden created buildings all other the world so as Residential, Houses, Housing, Hospitaly (Holiday Villages, Hotels and Resorts and Multipurpose Buildings as well as a comprehensive portrayal of the  church centres built in Europe and Africa. Planning and architectural systems developed by Dahinden himself have resulted in interesting solutions both in Europe and in the Middle East.

Justus Dahinden has received for his buildings and projects a number of international awards. The most prestigious of these ist the "[[Grand_Prix_d'Archictecture|Grand Prix d'Archictecture]]" which was awarded in [[1981|1981]] in [[Paris|Paris]] for the holiday village Twannberg built by the Swiss Social Foundation. This prize has previously been awarded, for example, to the City of Amsterdam, to Le Corbusier and to the Government of the Punjab in India for the buildings in Chandigarh.
