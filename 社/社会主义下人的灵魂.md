Wilde, as we have seen, declared himself an anarchist on at least one occasion during the 1890s, and he greatly admired [[Kropotkin|Kropotkin]], whom he had met. Later, in De Profundis, he described Kropotkin's life as one "of the most perfect lives I have come across in my own experience" and talked of him as "a man with a soul of that beautiful white Christ that seems coming out of Russia." But in The Soul of Man Under Socialism, which appeared in 1890, it is Godwin rather than Kropotkin whose influence seems dominant."

(pg. 447)</ref>。王尔德读了[[彼得·阿列克谢耶维奇·克鲁泡特金|彼得·阿列克谢耶维奇·克鲁泡特金]]的作品后转向了[[无政府主义|无政府主义]]哲学，从而创造了此文。<ref>"In England, the Irish poet and dramatist Oscar Wilde declared himself an anarchist and, under Kropotkin's inspiration, wrote the essay 'The Soul of Man Under Socialism'" — "[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-66523/anarchism#539312.hook Anarchism as a movement, 1870–1940]", [[Encyclopædia_Britannica|Encyclopædia Britannica]], 2007</ref>
